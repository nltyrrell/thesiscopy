\section{Data}

This section will outline the data used for this project, including processing 
performed, a discussion of uncertainties for each data set and any inherent 
limitations.

\subsection{Observational Data}

Three data products from the UK Met Office Hadley centre and the University of 
East Anglia Climatic Research Unit were used as surface temperatures 
observations; Climatic Research Unit land Temperature data set, version 
4 (CRUTEM4) \citep{Brohan2006}, the Hadley Centre SST data set,
version 2 (HadSST2) \citep{Rayner2006} and the Hadley Centre global sea ice and 
and SST, version 1 (HadISST) (ref).

HadSST2 is global gridded SST dataset based on observations, with the data 
coverage decreasing with time. Prior to 1950 data coverage is too sparse to 
allow strong statistical conclusions \citep{Dommenget2009}, and measuring the 
land/sea interactions by comparison with CRUTEM4 can lead to errors. This 
dataset, along with CRUTEM4, was used for observations as it was considered the 
truest representation, as there is no interpolation or processing done on the 
data; other than that to correct inconsistencies. (Data coverage discussion?)

CRUTEM4 is a global gridded land temperature dataset based on observations.  
Regarding the data coverage; there are large areas without data in the tropics, 
particularly in tropical Africa and Amazonian South America. Global climate 
model experiments show that these areas may be important in terms of the land 
response to tropical SST perturbations, as such the effect of this missing data 
is investigated further in Chapter \ref{evidence} by masking the model results 
to simulate the data coverage of the observations and testing the robustness of 
the statistics used to measure the land/sea contrast. It is found the data 
coverage issues may effect the magnitude of some results but not the 
conclusions.

HadISST1 is a global gridded SST dataset based on observations, and interpolated 
in regions without data. It uses the same sources as HadSST2 but as missing data 
points are interpolated there is no decreases in coverage with time. The 
increased amount of interpolation means there is no increase in information so 
the dataset is no more useful than HadSST2 when comparing to land temperatures.  
Instead, the HadISST1 data is used as the input for model runs. The data prior 
to 1950 is still used for AMIP-type experiments (see \ref{methods:amip}) because 
even though it is unsuitable for comparing the land and ocean timeseries	it 
is suitable as a representation of realistic SST variability. For the AMIP runs 
we want to see how the land surface responds to SST variability and the 
interpolated SST data is suitable for this.

All observational data was linearly detrended, as linear trends strongly 
influence correlations and would lead to spuriously high correlations.  However,
variability on decadal timescales was not removed, and it was decided that 
simple linear detrend would be sufficient to remove the long-term variability 
most affecting any correlations and regressions with the least amount of 
processing.

\subsection{Reanalysis Data}

The NCEP-Reanalysis dataset uses a forecast model (ref, details) that 
assimilates past observational data as boundary conditions. The result is a high 
spatial and temporal resolution gridded dataset of surface and tropospheric 
variables, as close to observations as possible.  Only satellite data is used 
which mean the length is limited to satellite era, post 1979. The NCEP data was 
Used in initial investigations as alternative to Hadley Centre observations.

\subsection{Coupled Model Data}

For the analysis of CGCMs we used all available pre-industrial control runs from 
the CMIP5 datasets \citep{Taylor2012}, see Table \ref{tab:cmip5} for the full 
list. The pre-industrial control runs, which lack any anthropogenic or natural 
radiative forcings (i.e. no changes in CO$_2$, volcanoes, etc)  were chosen in 
order to study the unforced internal variability. 100 years from each of the 35 
models was used, and anomalies were defined seperately for each model relative 
to its climatology. The multi-model mean of the CMIP5 data was calculated using 
the anomalous (relative to each modelâ€™s climatology) timeseries from each model, 
these were combined end-to-end to generate a 3500 year timeseries.

\section{Model Experiments}

This section will describe the models that were used, and the core experiments 
performed with each model.


\subsection{ACCESS}

The Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS) model 
\citep{Bi2013} uses the UK Meteorological Office Unified Model with HadGEM2 
atmospheric physics (\citet{Davies2005}; \citet{Martin2010}; 
\citet{Bellouin2011}). We used a lo-res version with an atmospheric resolution 
of N48 ($3.75^{\circ} \times 2.5^{\circ}$) as described in \citet{Frauen2014}.  
The model was either forced with prescribed SSTs or coupled to a slab ocean (the 
slab ocean is described in section \ref{methods:pacemaker}).

Three primary types of experiments were conducted: AMIP-type; sensitivity to 
mean SST increases or decreases; and El Ni{\~n}o pattern forcing experiments, 
see Table \ref{tab:senseexp} for full details. In addition there were control 
runs, one with a 12-month climatology of SSTs and one with a slab ocean.  The El 
Ni{\~n}o forcing experiments are similar in style to `pacemaker' experiments, as 
described by ~\citealt{Alexander1992}, ~\citealt{Alexander1992a}, 
~\citealt{Lau2000} and ~\citealt{Lu2011}.

\subsubsection{AMIP-Type experiments}\label{methods:amip}
AMIP (Atmosphere-only Model Inter-comparison Project, (ref)), much like CMIP, is 
a project to compare results from many modelling centres, except instead of the 
coupled ocean-atmosphere models from CMIP the models are forced with 
observational SSTs.  Therefore an we consider an AMIP-type experiment one where 
a model is forced with observational, or similar to observational SSTs. There 
are a few benefits to this setup; it allows us to test the effect of a range of 
SST anomalies on continental temperatures, it is computationally much cheaper 
than a coupled run and doesn't require long spin up times, and the contained 
boundary conditions stabilise the model and prevent drift. The key limitation of 
AMIP runs is the loss of atmosphere to ocean feedbacks which are potentially 
important for the eveolution of both systems. This downside is partially 
addressed with the use of a mixed-layer slab ocean, discussed in section 
\ref{methods:pacemaker}.

The AMIP type runs used HadISST from 1870 to 2010. While it was determined that 
HadSST2 data was only suitable from 1950 for calculating statistics relating to 
the observational value of the land/sea contrast, the HadISST data was used from 
1870. The reason is that the HadISST SSTs were primarily used as a 
representation of realistic interannual variability with which to force the 
atmospheric model.  In the AMIP runs the SST and $T_{land}$ are consistent 
because $T_{land}$ responds to the prescribed SST.  Whether or not these were 
the true SST values in the real world is not important in the context of this 
study.  We use the early SST values from HadISST to generate realistic SST 
variability; thus we can use the earlier period to get more statistics. In the 
statistical analysis of observed SST verse land the errors in the observed SST 
do matter as they no longer co-vary with the land, so we cannot use the early 
SST and $T_{land}$ values.

\subsubsection{Half-AMIP/Half-1K experiments}
Simulations forced with idealised SST patterns used a 12 month climatology of 
the HadISST data from 1950-2010 as the reference control climate. The division 
between tropics and extra-tropics for these experiments was chosen to be 
$28^{\circ}$N/S, with the tropical forcing applied to the oceans in the zonal 
band bordered by $28^{\circ}$N/S, and the extra-tropical forcing applied from 
$28^{\circ}$N/S to the poles. For the model resolution used this most closely 
divides the oceans in half by area, with slightly more area in the 
extra-tropics.

\subsubsection{Pacemaker experiment}\label{methods:pacemaker}
For the El Ni{\~n}o pattern forcing experiments a canonical El Ni{\~n}o pattern 
was generated using HadISST monthly mean data from a linear regression between 
NINO3 and SSTs, as shown in Figure 1. This pattern was imposed in the tropical 
Pacific between $30^{\circ}$N/S and $155^{\circ}$E to the eastern boundary of 
the Pacific, on to monthly climatological SSTs (i.e. a repeating 12 month 
seasonal cycle).  The values of the anomaly was based on the regression values, 
with a maximum temperature anomaly of 1.41K.  The pattern was oscillated with a 
period of 4 years, peaking in January.  Outside of the tropical Pacific there 
were two scenarios; fixed SSTs using the HadISST 1950-2010 climatology, and the 
slab ocean.  

The slab ocean is essentially a series of 1D ocean columns and assumes a 
constant mixed layer depth of 50 metres. It is forced by flux correction terms 
to have on average the HadISST 1950--2010 SST climatology \citep{Wang2014}. A 
constant mixed layer was chosen in part for simplicity as this model setup is 
intended to be of intermediate complexity, between a simple prescribed SST run 
and a fully coupled dynamic ocean. We use a slab ocean as simple way of 
modelling SST variability, and while we would expect that the response time of 
the remote oceans to an external forcing would scale with mixed layer depth 
(\citealt{Su2005a}, \citealt{Lintner2007}), the constant 50 metre assumption 
gives a first order but realistic response.  


\subsection{One and Two-Dimensional Radiative-Convective Model}
Simplified atmospheric models have long been used to elucidate the underlying 
mechanisms of otherwise complicated problems (ref). To understand the 
relationship between SSTs, tropospheric temperatures and $T_{land}$ response we 
used a radiative-convective column model. A radiative-convective model is one 
where the atmospheric heating by convection is balanced with radiative cooling 
(ref Manabe, Wetherald 1967 etc) and have been used in a myriad of studies, such 
as the equilibrium response to CO$_2$ (ref) and solar forcings (ref), climate 
sensitivity (ref), the organisation of deep convection (ref) and the atmospheric 
sctuctural response to SSTs and boundary layer humidity (hamish and adam, ref).  
There have been studies using RCE over simple land surfaces (ref) and more 
recently with more realistic land representations \citep{Rochetin2014}.

\subsubsection{Model details}
We utilised the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) radiative-convective 
model.  First described by \citet{Renno1994} and updated in \citet{Bony2001}.  
The convection scheme was first described in \citet{Emanuel1991} and improved in 
\citet{Emanuel1999}. The radiative transfer scheme is from the European Center 
for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) operational model, and is split into a 
shortwave scheme as described in \citet{Fouquart1980} and the longwave scheme 
from \citet{Morcrete1991a}. The fractional cloud scheme of \citet{Bony2001} is 
coupled to the convection scheme and also controls the interaction of clouds and 
radiation. The boundary layer is modeled with a dry adiabatic adjustment to all 
variables. Surface fluxes are calculated with bulk aerodynamic formulas using a 
specified wind speed.  The surface can be modelled as prescribed SSTs, a mixed 
layer ocean or a simple land surface, the latter by specifying the evaporative 
fraction and a shallow mixed layer depth. The model geometry can be set as a 
single column (1D) or as a two dimensional (2D) model in a zonal or meridional 
directions. The model can also be run in Weak Temperature Gradient mode (WTG 
mode) as described in \citet{Sobel2000}. For this setup, which relies on the WTG 
approximation as discussed in section \ref{intro:wtg}, the free tropospheric 
temperature profile is specified and remains fixed, allowing the vertical 
velocity and, hence precipation to be prognostic variables.
The 2D model uses the same schemes for radiation and convection as the 1D model 
with an additional linear dynamical scheme that is hydrostatic and non-rotating.  
First described in \citet{Nilsson1999} the model we used was closer to the one 
described in \citet{Abbot2007}, as the latter used land and ocean columns 
instead of just ocean columns. The schematic in Figure \ref{fig:schem2d} shows 
the processes modelled.

	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{{2007_Abbot_Emanuel_Fig1}.pdf}
	\caption{Figure 1 from \citet{Abbot2007}, a schematic of the two-column 
	model in zonal-height plane.}
	\label{fig:schem2d}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Experiments}
The low computing power required to run a simple model allows for many and 
varied experiments, as well as efficient parameter testing. There were three key 
groups of experiments performed with the MIT model; 1D prescribed SST-WTG 
experiment; 2D prescribed SST land-ocean experiment; and 2D CO$_2$ forced 
land-ocean experiment. In addition to the core experiments there were tests on 
the model parameters controlling the land surface, boundary layer, the 
interaction of clouds and radiation, and the sensitivity of the results to the 
domain size and number of model levels.

\subsubsection{1D SST-WTG experiment}
The 1D SST-WTG experiments consisted of two key parts; initially the model was 
run without the WTG mode and a range of temperature profiles were generated by 
varying prescribed SSTs. These generated free tropospheric temperature profiles 
were then imposed above a responsive land surface using the WTG mode, with the 
temperature below a set level able to vary. The model is run to equilibrium for 
each profile and the resulting land surface temperature is compared with the SST 
used to generate the profile.  In addition to the different temperature profiles 
the evaporative fraction of the land can be varied, as well as the height below 
which the temperature profile is fixed.

\subsubsection{2D prescribed SST land-ocean experiment}
For these experiments the model was aligned zonally or meridionally with various 
numbers of land and ocean columns, the simplest being two columns; one land, one 
ocean. These runs were forced by varying the SSTs around a mean value suitable 
for the chosen latitude. The model was run to equilibrium, and the SST values 
compared with the resulting land surface temperatures.

\subsubsection{2D CO$_2$ forced land-ocean experiment}
The geometry of these experiments were similar to the 2D prescribed SST 
experiments, but instead of forcing with SST changes the model was forced 
through changes in CO$_2$. Both the land and ocean columns able to respond to 
the forcing. As this study primarily deals with natural variability a CO$_2$ 
forced experiment may seem unusual but it was useful as it allowed us to test 
our assumptions about comparisons between global warming land/ocean thermal 
contrast, and an understanding of the sensitivity of the modelled land and ocean 
surfaces to an external forcing puts the other results in context.



\subsection{Globally Resolved Energy Balance Model}

The final model that was used in this study is the Globally Resolved Energy 
Balance (GREB) model \citep{Dommenget2011}. Energy balance models have long been 
used to measure global surface temperatures in equilibrium (ref) and the 
response to external forcings (ref, ref). Early energy balance models were often 
one dimensional and lacking many important processes, but despite this the 
resutls were often realistic. For example, initial estimates of climate 
sensitivity have proven remarkably robust - Arrhenius' estimation a global 
temperature change of around \SI{5}{\celsius} for a doubling of CO$_2$ (ref) is 
within the uncertainty limits of studies in the recent literature (ref).  From 
the starting point of simple energy balance models, processes and feedbacks were 
added and the models became more realistic, but the potential for non-linear 
interaction between sytems increase.  This can inhibit our understanding of the 
mechanisms causing a response in the model and hence, the climate 
\citep{Dommenget2015}. 

\subsubsection{Model Details}
The GREB model is intended as a low complexity model to bridge the gap between 
simple one-dimensional models and coupled-GCMs. It allows testing of the global 
and regional response to external forcings and sensivity to changes in the mean 
climate \citep{Dommenget2015}. The GREB model has a resolution of 
\SI{3.75}{\degree} x \SI{3.75}{\degree} and three vertical levels; atmosphere, 
surface and subsurface ocean. The circulation, clouds, soil moisture and ocean 
mixed layer depth are all input as fixed boundary conditions using 12-month 
climatologies.  The simplicity of the model means it cannot accurately represent 
the mean climate without significant errors; hence the control climate has flux 
corrections to push the mean $T_{land}$, $T_{ocean}$ and $q_{air}$ (the 
atmospheric water vapour) to climatological values. The schematic in Figure 
\ref{fig:schemgreb}, taken from \citet{Dommenget2011}, demonstrates which 
physical processes are included in GREB. Despite its simplicity, GREB does a 
good job of modelling key features of the regional response to CO$_2$ 
\citep{Dommenget2015} including arctic amplification and the land/sea warming 
contrast.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{{2011_DommengetFloter_Fig2}.pdf}
	\caption{From \citet{Dommenget2011}, Figure 2, a schematic of the physical 
	processes included in the GREB model}
	\label{fig:schemgreb}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Experiments}
The simplicity of the GREB model allows for experiments that test the 
sensitivity of $T_{surf}$ to changes in the climatology of variables such as 
wind, soil moisture, clouds or atmospheric moisture. Further, we can use the 
GREB model in conjunction with the ACCESS model to understand the regional 
$T_{land}$ response to oceanic forcing. Using two key experiments, the AMIP and 
Pacemaker experiments, we take the response of certain atmospheric variables and 
use them to perturb the GREB model to attempt to recreate the GCM response. For 
example; the Pacemaker experiment has a constant 4 year cycle of forcing in the 
tropical Pacific which allows for the creation of a composite of positive and 
negative events by selecting the months corresponding to the maximum and minimum 
forcing.  Using the composite we create four anomalous fields; meridional and 
zonal winds, soil moisture and cloud cover. In addition to these we have the SST 
anomalies.  Each of these fields is then used to perturb the GREB model, 
initially as individual fields then in combinations. In this way we build an 
understanding of the regional importance of different aspects of the atmospheric 
response. While it is simple to create composites with the Pacemaker experiment, 
this is not so for the AMIP experiments, as the realistic SST forcing is highly 
variable in space and time.  In order to create anomalous fields from this 
experiment we use regressions between continental surface temperatures and the 
variable we are testing. Once again meridional and zonal winds, soil moisture, 
cloud response and anomolous SSTs are used to perturb the GREB model.

\section{Statistical methods}

This section will describe the statistical methods applied to the data and used 
in the analysis.


\subsection{Regression of land/ocean}\label{ssec:rlo}


The majority of the analysis is based on annual mean anomalies with the main 
exception in Section \ref{pacemaker}, which is based on monthly mean anomalies 
for monthly mean lag-lead correlations. The land/sea contrast, $R_{L/S}$, is 
defined by the following regression model;

\begin{equation}
T_{land} = R_{L/S} \cdot T_{ocean}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	R_{L/S} = \rho_{land,ocean}\cdot \frac{\sigma_{land}}{\sigma_{ocean}}
\end{equation}

With $T_{land}$ and $T_{ocean}$ as the annual mean surface temperature anomalies 
of areal-averaged land and ice-free oceans (global or zonal average), 
respectively, $\rho_{land,ocean}$ is the correlation coefficient between 
$T_{land}$ and $T_{ocean}$, and $\sigma_{land}, \sigma_{ocean}$ are the standard 
deviations of $T_{land}, T_{ocean}$. While regression coefficients are often 
used to measure co-variability, $R_{L/S}$ can also be thought of as an 
amplification factor; how much is the temperature of land amplified compared to 
the SST. A simple ratio, as for the land/sea contrast in global warming, is 
unsuitable as we are dealing with anomalies varying around zero. As a simple 
example, if the anomalous SSTs are +1K the first year and -1K the second, and 
the land temperature is +1.5K then -1.5K respectively, we have a value of 
$R_{L/S} = 1.5$. In this way we consider the regression coefficient an 
appropriate measure of the land/sea temperature contrast in interannual 
variability.
