%	+1K Experiments
%-----------------------------------
\subsection{+1K experiments}

Figure \ref{fig:1K} shows the surface temperature response (control removed) 
from the +1K experiments; where +1K was added to the oceans in the tropics, 
extra-tropics or globally. In response to a tropical SST perturbation there is a 
large tropical response, greatest over equatorial South America and Africa, 
India and the maritime continent (Fig.\ref{fig:1K} a). The tropical +1K ocean 
perturbation leads to $T_{land}>+1$K in most tropical areas. Thus the SST 
forcing is amplified. The extra-tropical land the response to the tropical 
forcing is not significant everywhere, but some regions also show an amplified 
response to the tropical SST forcing (e.g. central Asia and parts of Europe and 
North America).  An extra-tropical $T_{land}$ response to tropical SST is seen 
for seasonal averages in the winter months of each hemisphere, the Northen 
Hemsiphere winter response is shown in Figure \ref{fig:1K}e.

When looking at the annual mean response of $T_{land}$ to extra-tropical SST 
perturbations there is little significant response, however for seasonal 
averages both hemispheres show a significant response in their respective winter 
months, shown for the Northern Hemisphere in Figure \ref{fig:1K} e-g. The 
response of $T_{land}$ is also amplified in some regions relative to the initial 
perturbation.  However, the extra-tropical forcing again leads to a weaker land 
response than the tropical forcing, as was also found in the AMIP simulations.  
Also similar to the AMIP simulations we again find that the  global SST forcing 
has a bigger impact than the tropical only forcing for the annual mean. In 
addition the response of the global SST forcing is greater than the 
superposition of the tropical and extra-tropical forcing (comparing 
Fig.\ref{fig:1K} c and d).  This again indirectly suggests that the 
extra-tropical SST forcing does lead to a significant land response.

% Tropical Troposphere
%-----------------------------------

\subsection{Tropical Troposphere}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Strong land/ocean connection
	\item Variability in SSTs lead to amplified temperature variation in 
		troposphere.
	\item Tropical tropospheric unable to sustain large temperature gradients.
	\item Perturbations efficiently transported around tropical regions.
	\item Uniform perturbations over land and ocean.
	\item In the mean - response of surface temperature differs more over land 
		and ocean.
	\item Increase in variability due to ocean forcing.
\end{itemize}

%-----------------------------------
%	Half-AMIP
%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Half-AMIP}

In Figure \ref{fig:ftest} f-tests are used to measure the increase in annual 
temperature variability due to SST variability at the surface and at the 300hPa 
pressure level relative to a simulation with fixed SST climatology. Figure  
\ref{fig:ftest} a) and b) show that global SST variability has a substantial 
impact on the tropical atmospheric and surface temperature variability. However, 
in the extra-tropical regions the impact is much weaker, but still statistically 
significant in some regions.

In order to separate the influence of the tropical SST variability from that of 
the extra-tropical SST, we repeat the AMIP experiment forced with the historical 
SST variability just in the tropics or just in the extra-tropical regions. The 
impact of the tropical SST variability is similar to the global SST variability, 
with a clear and strong impact in the tropical regions.  The AMIP simulation 
with just the extra-tropical SST variability has only a very weak to no impact 
on the regional (grid-box scale) atmospheric and surface temperature 
variability.  However, if we compare the global AMIP versus the tropical only 
AMIP run we still can see a somewhat larger increase in variance over land in 
the global AMIP run. This indirectly suggests that the extra-tropical SST 
forcing does play a role, although it is much smaller than the tropical forcing.  
In summary the AMIP experiments suggest a clear tropical SST forcing to the 
atmospheric and land surface temperatures, but a much weaker or no forcing from 
the extra-tropical SST.


\subsection{Lapse Rate}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Forcing regions over tropical oceans show large amplification in upper 
		troposphere due to moist convection.
	\item Responding tropical areas - both land and over ocean - similar, i.e.  
		regresion profile figure.
	\item Continental lapse rate more variable due to lower mean humidity.
\end{itemize}

\section{ENSO}
\begin{itemize}
	\item ENSO is source of tropical inter-annual variability.
	\item Temperature anomaly seen throughout tropical troposphere
	\item Land responds quickly - within a month - to initial anomaly.
	\item Remote tropical oceans response is delayed by 3-4 months.
	\item Timing of delay of remote tropical oceans is a function of mixed layer 
		depth.
	\item Land responds to the delayed forcing by remote trop oceans.
	\item Mean land response appears to be delayed, i.e. when plotted with lag 
		correlations.
	\item Delayed land response is linear combination of initial response to 
		Pacific ocean and response to delayed remote tropical oceans.
	\item Land response is amplified due to previously discussed process.
	\item The land response is further amplified by secondary response to remote 
		tropics.

%	Regional Response
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Regional Response}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Lapse rate theory works well in the mean continental response over 
		land.
	\item According to theory it would be expected that dryer regions would have 
		larger response, since difference in humidity is primary driver of the 
		increased variability over land.
	\item We see from regional response that the magnitude of variability is not 
		correlated with the dryness of the land surface.
	\item In addition to thermodynamic changes, tropical SSTs induce changes in 
		cloud cover, energy transport by winds, soil moisture changes.
	\item Regional importance of these discussed...
