\section{Introduction}
% \paragraph{Discuss GW theories, relevance to interannual var.}
In chapter \ref{evidence} we showed evidence for the interannual land/ocean 
temperature contrast in observations and models, and discussed its magnitude and 
spatial extent. Through AMIP simulations it was shown that an $R_{l/o}>1$ can 
exist in a model forced only with SST variability. By prescribing SSTs we remove 
the effect of ocean heat capacity - and it's ability to cause $R_{l/o}>1$ by 
damping the ocean's response relative to the land response for a uniform 
forcing. The implication is that the variability from the ocean is being 
amplified over the continents. In this chapter we will attempt to determine the 
underlying mechanisms responsible for the amplification of ocean surface 
temperature anomalies over land. 

We begin in Section \ref{mech_inftrop} with a range of sensitivity experiments 
using the ACCESS AGCM forced with SSTs or coupled to a slab ocean to look at the 
ability of the tropical and extra-tropical oceans to influence continental 
tempratures. In Section \ref{mech_lapse} there is a discussion of the importance 
of the lapse rates above land and ocean and their relationship to the land/ocean 
contrast in both global warming and interannual scenarios. This leads in to 
experiments with a single-column and multi-column atmospheric model, which are 
presented in Section \ref{mech_scm} and Section \ref{mech_mcm}. In these 
sections we use the simplified model to understand the importance of the 
vertical structure of the atmosphere and surface properties while controlling 
for large scale circulation effects. These simplified models are compared to GCM 
results in Section \ref{mech_compare}, where it is found that the column models 
are unable to explain the temperature response in many continental regions.

Finally, in Section \ref{mech_greb} we use the Globally Resolved Energy Balance 
(GREB) model to explain the regional response that were not explained by the 
column model results. Aspects of the large scale circulation can be controlled 
in the GREB model, thus allowing us to test the importance of circulation 
changes to the continental surface temperature response to an ocean forcing.

\section{The Influence of Tropical Oceans on Land}
\label{mech_inftrop}

When looking at the relationship between $T_{land}$ and SSTs there is an 
asymmetry between the response of $T_{land}$ to tropical and extra-tropical SST 
forcing. We investigate this asymmetry and the importance of the tropical oceans 
in regulating regional and global land surface temperatures using modelling 
experiments. For our initial SST perturbation experiments we divide global 
oceans into tropics and extra-tropics, with each area being approximately equal.  
In the 1K experiments a constant +/-1K SST anomaly is applied to tropical or 
extra-tropical regions, as well as globally. This is more similar to a global 
warming experiment and while the overarching focus of this study is on 
variability it is useful to see the response to a uniform warming or cooling.  
Variability is then introduced in the Half-AMIP experiments. The oceans are 
divided into tropical and extra-tropical regions, as with the 1K experiments, 
but instead of a constant forcing, variability is imposed using observed SST 
anomalies. The ``half ocean" experiments will show the importance of the 
tropical oceans, then the regional importance of SSTs is further clarified in 
the Pacemaker experiments. The only region of active forcing in the Pacemaker 
experiments is in the tropical Pacific, where a canonical ENSO pattern is 
oscillated with a period of four years, peaking in January. Outside of the 
tropical Pacific a slab ocean or a fixed climatology of SSTs are used. In some 
sense this is a simplification of all ocean dynamics to what we see as the key 
components involved in the ocean's ability to force continental temperatures, at 
least on the timescales we are interested in, and this simplification will help 
to elucidate the mechanisms controlling the land/ocean contrast.

\subsection{Comparison of Tropical and Extra-Tropical forcing of Continental 
Temperatures.}

\subsubsection{1K Experiments}

Figure \ref{fig:1K} shows the surface temperature response (control removed) 
from the 1K experiments; where 1K was added to the oceans in the tropics, 
extra-tropics or globally. In response to a tropical SST perturbation there is a 
large tropical response, greatest over equatorial South America and Africa, 
India and the maritime continent (Fig.\ref{fig:1K} a). The tropical 1K ocean 
perturbation leads to $T_{land}>+1$K in most tropical areas. Thus the SST 
forcing is amplified. The extra-tropical land the response to the tropical 
forcing is not significant everywhere, but some regions also show an amplified 
response to the tropical SST forcing (e.g. central Asia and parts of Europe and 
North America).  An extra-tropical $T_{land}$ response to tropical SSTs is seen 
for seasonal averages in the winter months of each hemisphere, the Northern 
Hemisphere winter response is shown in Figure \ref{fig:1K} (e).

When looking at the annual mean response of $T_{land}$ to extra-tropical SST 
perturbations there is little significant response, however for seasonal 
averages both hemispheres show a significant response in their respective winter 
months, shown for the Northern Hemisphere in Figure \ref{fig:1K} e-g. The 
response of $T_{land}$ is also amplified in some regions relative to the initial 
perturbation.  However, the extra-tropical forcing again leads to a weaker land 
response than the tropical forcing, as was also found in the AMIP simulations.  
Also similar to the AMIP simulations we again find that the  global SST forcing 
has a bigger impact than the tropical only forcing for the annual mean. In 
addition the response of the global SST forcing is greater than the 
superposition of the tropical and extra-tropical forcing (comparing 
Fig.\ref{fig:1K} c and d).  This again indirectly suggests that the 
extra-tropical SST forcing does lead to a significant land response.

\subsubsection{Half-AMIP Experiments}

In Figure \ref{fig:ftest} f-tests are used to measure the increase in annual 
temperature variability due to SST variability at the surface and at the 300hPa 
pressure level relative to a simulation with fixed SST climatology. Figure  
\ref{fig:ftest} a) and d) show that global SST variability has a substantial 
impact on the tropical atmospheric and surface temperature variability. In the 
extra-tropical regions the impact is much weaker, but still statistically 
significant in some regions.

In order to separate the influence of the tropical SST variability from that of 
the extra-tropical SST, we repeat the AMIP experiment forced with the historical 
SST variability just in the tropics or just in the extra-tropical regions. The 
impact of the tropical-only SST variability is similar to the global SST 
variability, with a clear and strong impact in the tropical regions.  The AMIP 
simulation with extra-tropical-only SST variability has only a very weak to no 
impact on the regional (grid-box scale) atmospheric and surface temperature 
variability.  However, if we compare the global AMIP versus the tropical only 
AMIP run we still can see a somewhat larger increase in variance over land in 
the global AMIP run. This indirectly suggests that the extra-tropical SST 
forcing does play a role, although it is much smaller than the tropical forcing.  
In summary the AMIP experiments suggest a clear tropical SST forcing to the 
atmospheric and land surface temperatures, but a much weaker or no forcing from 
the extra-tropical SST.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Tropical Troposphere}
\label{troptrop}
The Half-AMIP experiments demonstrate an important process in the strong 
tropical land/ocean connection. Figures \ref{fig:ftest} d)--e) show the value of 
an f-test on the 300hPa surface, measuring the increase (values above zero) in 
temperature variability due to imposed SST variability. The results for global 
and tropical AMIP runs are very similar, with the global AMIP having slightly 
higher values in the tropics and some more variability in the extratropics, 
whereas there's no significant tropospheric response to extra-tropical SSTs.  
The tropospheric response in the tropics can be described with two key 
processes; the large amplitude of the temperature variability is due to latent 
heating by deep moist convection, and the -- largely -- zonally uniform pattern 
is the result of the tropical free troposphere not being able to maintain 
horizontal pressure gradients due the small Coriolis number (REF). This results 
in tropical SST perturbations being amplified in the troposphere and efficiently 
transported over tropical land. The area with the largest tropospheric anomalies 
is over the eastern tropical pacific, the ENSO region. ENSO is the dominant 
driver of interannual temperature variability and while the ENSO induced 
tropospheric anomalies are distributed around the tropics, there is still a 
maximum in that area. The role of ENSO is further explored with the Pacemaker 
experiments.

\subsection{Pacemaker Experiments}\label{pacemaker}

On inter-annual timescales ENSO is the most significant global climate driver. 
It is therefore remarkable that in the analysis of the CMIP5 model simulations 
the NINO3 region did not show up with a high correlation to global $T_{land}$ 
(see Fig.\ref{fig:cmip_cormap}). The ENSO region in the tropical Pacific has a 
lower correlation with $T_{land}$ than adjacent regions and the other ocean 
basins. Using the combined monthly mean CMIP5 surface temperature anomalies, 
Fig.\ref{fig:xcor} e) shows the lagged correlations between NINO3 SST and global 
$T_{land}$. The NINO3 region is seen to lead global land by 4 months.  Typically 
land has a fast response time to forcings, which would not result in a 
4 month delay, so this result suggests that the full land response is not 
directly forced by the NINO3 SST but is most likely caused by something else. 
This other forcing may be delayed to the ENSO variability by about 4 months. 
Since we have seen in Fig.\ref{fig:cmip_cormap} that global $T_{land}$ is highly 
correlated to other tropical ocean SST, it seems likely that $T_{land}$ is 
linked to the slower ocean response in the remote tropical oceans and not 
directly to the NINO3 region.

To address this question we conducted a series of idealised ENSO-response 
experiments. In the first experiment we prescribe an oscillating ENSO pattern (a 
regression between NINO3 and SSTs shown in Fig.\ref{fig:regpat}) in the tropical 
Pacific and a fixed 12 month climatology of SSTs elsewhere.  The oscillation 
period of the ENSO signal is 4 years, peaking in January. In the second 
experiment we allow SST variability outside the tropical Pacific simulated by a 
simple slab ocean model with a mixed layer depth of 50 metres.  Thus, in the 
second experiment the global ocean SSTs can respond to the oscillating ENSO 
pattern forcing.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{{regpat}.eps}\\
	\caption{Pattern used in ENSO experiments. Result of regression between NINO3 
	and global SST.}
	\label{fig:regpat}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Delayed Response}
\label{xcor}
Figure \ref{fig:xcor} (i-l) shows cross-correlations from the ENSO-FIXSST and 
ENSO-Slab forcing experiments. In i) and j) we see that for the fixed SST 
experiment the global and tropical land responds to the ENSO-like forcing (red 
line), and does so without the delay seen in Figure \ref{fig:xcor} e). When a 
slab ocean is introduced the land responds with a realistic delay of around 4 
months.  The peak slab ocean response is at 6 months, implying that the land is 
responding immediately to the initial Pacific ocean forcing and then 
subsequently to the delayed slab ocean response. The delayed land response is 
also associated with a higher correlation to the NINO3 region. Comparing the 
global and tropical averages, the main difference is the magnitude of the peak 
correlation, but in the tropics the slab ocean also results in the peak land 
correlation being higher than the peak ocean correlation. So the delayed 
response of the remote tropical oceans to a Pacific ocean forcing explains both 
the delayed land response and some part of the amplification of the oceanic 
temperature signal over land. In the extra-tropics there is only a very weak 
influence of the ENSO forcing on land temperatures in the sensitivity 
experiments (Fig.  \ref{fig:xcor} g, h), and the tropical Pacific has little 
influence on the slab ocean in the extra-tropics. The observations and CMIP5 
models also don't show a significant relationship between the extra-tropics and 
NINO3 (Fig.\ref{fig:xcor} g,h,k,l).

To summarise thus far; we see that tropical SSTs strongly influence tropical and 
- to a lesser extent - extra-tropical continental temperatures; SST anomalies 
are amplified in the tropical troposphere and efficiently transported over land; 
ENSO is the dominant source of interannual variability and can influence land 
surface temperatures via the troposphere. However we now wish to investigate the 
process by which SST variability leads to amplified $T_{land}$ variability.

\subsection{The Lapse Rate Mechanism}
\label{mech_lapse}

The Figure \ref{fig:ftest} (d) and (e) in section \ref{troptrop} the 
tropospheric temperature response to imposed SST variability shows a zonally 
homogenous temperature response throughout the free troposphere with a larger 
signal in the tropics, hence no land/ocean contrast at higher levels in the 
atmosphere and an amplified response at the land surface.  A known feature of 
the land/ocean contrast in global warming is that the land and ocean temperature 
difference dissappears at a certain height in the free troposphere 
(\citealt{Joshi2007}, \citealt{Dommenget2009}, \citealt{Byrne2013a}). A lapse rate 
mechanism was described by \citet{Joshi2007} and \citet{Byrne2013a} to explain 
the land/ocean warming contrast that exists in global warming scenarios, and  
the homogenous free tropospheric temperatures are an important feature of the 
theories. Although the theories were devised for the global warming scenario, 
the homogenous tropospheric response in Figure \ref{fig:ftest} indicates that 
there are similarities between the global warming and interannual land/ocean 
contrast, which we believe justifies testing the validity of the lapse rate 
theories in explaining the interannual land/ocean contrast. 

The usefulness of the lapse rate theory in interannual variability will be 
explored by looking at the tropospheric structure in the ENSO-Pacemaker 
experiment. This experiment is uniquely suitable for this analysis as it has  
distinct regions of ocean forcing in the Tropical Pacifc, ocean response in the 
remote oceans and land response. The ability to seperate the forcing and 
response of land and ocean is useful when comparing their atmospheri profiles.

\subsection{The tropospheric response in the Pacemaker Experiments}

We are going to use the Pacemaker experiments to test the relationship between 
the land and ocean surfaces and the troposphere above them. As mentioned the 
advantage of using the Pacemaker experimental design is the ability to separate 
forced and responding regions.  We first compare the Pacemaker experiment with a 
climatology run (i.e. no SST variability) to investigate the vertical structure 
of the atmosphere in ACCESS and the relationship between land and ocean 
temperatures.

Using tropical averages of SSTs and land temperatures, Figure 
\ref{fig:linreg_plev} shows regression values for the $T_{tropos}$ at different 
pressure levels as a function of the surface temperature $T_{land}$ (a) and 
$T_{ocean}$ (b). The green line represents the column of air above tropical 
land, the blue line represents the column of air above tropical ocean. The black 
line represents the column above the remote tropical ocean, we define the remote 
tropical ocean as the tropical oceans with the area of forcing removed.  Looking 
first at Figure \ref{fig:linreg_plev} a), in the simulation without any SST 
variability (dashed lines), the regression values between the surface and 
tropospheric temperatures falls to zero above \SI{800}{\hecto\pascal}, 
indicating that the upper level tropical temperatures over land areas are not 
related to $T_{land}$; the atmospheric internal $T_{land}$ variability 
(independent of SST variability) is limited to the near surface layers and is 
not strongly related to the upper free $T_{tropos}$. In the simulation with SST 
variability, the tropospheric temperature shows a strong relationship with the 
surface $T_{land}$ variability at all levels. The regression values going to 
zero above land when there is no SST variability implies a one way relationship; 
SSTs can influence $T_{land}$ via the upper troposphere, but $T_{land}$ is not 
able to independently influence the upper troposphere.

Now focusing on Figure \ref{fig:linreg_plev} b), a distinctive feature for the 
troposphere above oceans (blue line) is the large increase in the regression 
values in the upper troposphere. This is a well known signature of moist
convection; a \SI{1}{\kelvin} anomaly at the surface corresponds to a 
\SI{2}{\kelvin} anomaly in the upper level temperatures due to the latent heat 
release by moist convection (\citealt{Joshi2007}, \citealt{Dommenget2009}, 
\citealt{Byrne2013}, etc.).  The regression coefficient over the ocean has a 
larger peak than over the land in the upper troposphere --  
\SIrange{500}{200}{\hecto\pascal}.  However, in the middle troposphere -- around 
the \SIrange{700}{500}{\hecto\pascal} level -- the two lines coincide, similar 
to the level in the atmosphere described by \citet{Joshi2007} where there is no 
land/ocean warming contrast. Variability increases above land in the levels 
below \SI{800}{\hecto\pascal}.  This figure indicates a value of $R_{l/o}$ of 
around 1.2, as for a \SI{1}{\kelvin} anomaly of $T_{ocean}$ we have a 
\SI{1.2}{\kelvin} response in $T_{land}$.  

As we saw in section \ref{pacemaker}, the remote oceans are important in the 
timing and magnitude of the continental land ENSO response, so we will now 
discuss their response to the Pacific ocean forcing. An advantage of the 
Pacemaker experimental design is that the area of ocean forcing is very well 
constrained.  In contrast, when using observations or coupled models to look at 
the response to an ENSO forcing the remote tropical oceans will also have their 
own, potentially considerable, internal variability due to ocean dynamics.  In 
the Pacemaker experiment the remote slab oceans have no dynamics, hence 
variability results only from the atmospheric fluxes.  Therefore, we can 
consider the Pacific Ocean an external forcing to both the continental regions 
and the remote oceans, and measure the separate response of land and ocean.  In 
Figure \ref{fig:linreg_plev} b) the black line is a measurement of the 
atmospheric response above remote oceans, the only variability for this region 
is imposed via the Pacific ocean forcing.  The remote tropical response is 
similar to the land response in shape; it also lacks the large amplification in 
the upper troposphere indicating that the upper levels are responding to the 
Pacific forcing and not being driven by their own moist convection.  At all 
levels the response above the remote tropical oceans is damped when compared to 
the land response which means there is no clear level where there is no 
land/ocean contrast however the two lines diverge more near the surface, with 
the largest difference between the gradients of the temperature profiles below 
\SI{800}{\hecto\pascal}.  In the global warming lapse rate theory, the steeper 
near-surface continental lapse rate is due to reduced moisture availability and 
thus lower relative humidities. It would appear that a similar process is active 
on interannual timescales with an additional factor; the tropospheric profile 
above a region of the ocean that is responding to an external forcing -- or a 
forcing from a separate ocean basin -- will be potentially be damped throughout 
the entire troposphere.  The vertical structure above land and ocean is further 
explored with a one and two-dimensional model.

\end{figure}

We have a seen a similarity between the Joshi theory and the interannual 
response. This shows the mechanism appears active in the statistics of the 
Pacemaker experiment, now we want to explore this further. To investigate the 
physical mechanisms we will use a simpler model, one that we can limit the 
variables to discern the important physical mechanisms that control the response 
we have seen.

\section{Tropospheric and surface response to ocean forcing in a Single-Column 
Model}
\label{mech_scm}


The ENSO-Pacemaker experiments have a distinctive response in the troposphere 
above land and ocean areas. The temperature profiles above land and ocean appear
consistent with the lapse rate mechanism outlined by \citet{Joshi2007} and 
\citet{Byrne2013}, and therefor warrant further investigation. This will be 
acheived with simplified atmospheric models. In this section we will use a 
single-column model to analyse the tropospheric response to an SST forcing, and 
the land surface response to a tropospheric forcing.\\
To understand how the physical processes occur we first look at how the 
atmosphere responds in the ocean column to SST variations, and then investigate 
the impact of tropospheric temperature changes on the land surface 
temperature.\\
We use a single-column model for three main reasons: the idealised nature of the 
model allows us to impose a tropospheric temperature profile, thus simulating a 
tropospheric temperature forcing; we can control the land surface properties; 
and we can increase the vertical resolution of the model which will prove useful 
when testing the finer details of the differences between the Joshi and Byrne \& 
O'Gorman theories.\\

There are two main parts to the experimental setup; i) the ocean forcing of the 
troposphere, and ii) the tropospheric forcing of a land surface. For part i) we	 
generate temperature profiles in an ocean column which are to be used in part 
ii). To generate the profiles we begin with a mean SST suitable for the tropical 
band, generally around \SI{26}{\degreeCelsius}. We vary the SST above and below 
the chosen mean value, and for each SST value we run the model to equilibrium, 
in this way we end up with a range of temperature profiles varying around a mean 
value, and when comparing the results to observations or GCMs we consider each 
SST value to be equivalent to an annual temperature. A full discussion of the 
generation of tropospheric temperature profiles in the ocean column is in 
section \ref{trop_response_ocean}.

Once we have generated the tropospheric temperature profiles above an ocean the 
next step is to use them as a forcing above a land surface. For this we utilise 
the Weak Temperature Gradient approximation, both in terms of the theoretical 
basis for imposing a tropospheric profile, and in practical terms. The 
single-column model has a weak temperature gradient mode, which allows the 
tropospheric temperature profile to be imposed above a certain height.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,trim={1cm 8cm 3cm 
1cm},clip=true]{scm_schematic.pdf}
\caption{Schematic of Single Column Model experimental setup}
\label{fig:scmschem}
\end{figure}

As we will see this model setup offers some useful insights into the problem, 
but the idealized nature of the model does lead to a number of problems.  From a 
more theoretical viewpoint, RCE models have not been studied extensively over 
land surfaces. Although not in the scope of this study, further work on the 
validity of RCE over a surface with restricted water would be of interest. For 
this study many of the experiments involved small changes in temperatures, to 
simulate those seen in interannual variability.  The model often responded with 
large variability, bringing in to question the stability of the model. It will 
be shown that timeseries of the surface temperatures exhibit chaotic bevavhiour, 
arising from the interaction of the convection and radiation schemes. It remains 
unclear how realistic some of this behaviour is, and leads to inconclusive 
results.

\subsection{Tropospheric response to imposed SSTs in a single column}
\label{trop_response_ocean}

Before we begin our land surface response experiments we must generate the 
tropospheric temperature profiles above an ocean surface. By looking at 
temperature profiles as we vary the SST about an average tropical value we can 
test the model response against the expected theoretical response. We chose an 
SST value of \SI{26}{\degreeCelsius} as the average profile, which is 
appropriate for the tropics. For this section we look at both small and large 
anomalies from a chosen mean value; large anomalies test the robustness of the 
model and small anomalies are more appropriate for modelling interannual 
variability.

In Figure \ref{fig:scmsstprof_large} (a) we see the temperature profile for a 
wide range of SST values. For each profile the model has been run to 
equilibrium, and an average of the last 100 days is taken. The difference 
between the profiles with increasing and decreasing SST values is more clearly 
shown in Figure \ref{fig:scmsstprof_large} (b). For this plot the mean profile 
was calculated using all values from \SIrange{19}{33}{\degreeCelsius}, and then 
the mean profile was subtracted from each individual profile to give the change 
relative to the mean. This shows the amplification of the anomaly with height.  
For example, with the run forced with \SI{33}{\degreeCelsius}, at the surface 
the temperature is \SI{7}{\kelvin} warmer than the mean, and at 
\SI{200}{\hecto\pascal} the profile is approximately \SI{14}{\kelvin} warmer.  
This amplification of surface anomalies with height is the consequence of the 
profile being close to moist adiabatic, as expected in convecting regions of the 
tropics. The amplification above the ocean surface is also important in the 
communication of SST anomalies from oceans to land.

\label{fig:scmsstprof_large}
\end{figure}

From Figure \ref{fig:scmsstprof_large} (b) it appears the temperature profiles 
are largely moist adiabatic, but we can confirm that by plotting the moist 
adiabats, see Figure \ref{fig:scmsstprof_ma}. The moist adiabat is calculated 
for each SST, then as with the model response the anomalies are taken relative 
to the mean of the moist adiabats for all SSTs. We see that that model follows 
the moist adiabat closely from \SIrange{1000}{600}{\hecto\pascal}, after which 
they diverge slightly with the model showing less amplification. From this we 
can conclude that for a wide range of SST values, and for large differences in 
SST of \SI{1}{\kelvin}, the troposphere in the ocean column is largely moist 
adiabatic.  We can now compare this to the smaller variations in SST used to 
model interannual variability.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{enso_prof_temp_anom_ma.eps}
\caption{a) Temperature anomaly relative to mean profile for SSTs from 
\SI{19}{\degreeCelsius} to \SI{34}{\degreeCelsius} b) Amplification relative to

\label{fig:scmsstprof_ma}
\end{figure}

The temperature profiles in Figure \ref{fig:scmsstinc_prof} showing small 
changes in SST values don't reveal anything unexpected, as any differences are 
too small to discern at this scale. The profiles are similar to 
\ref{fig:scmsstprof_large}a) with the exception that there is little change in 
the height of the tropopause for small SSt changes. As with Figure 
\ref{fig:scmsstprof_large} b) the anomalous profiles were calculated using the 
mean of all SSTs, the result is Figure \ref{fig:scmsstinc_prof} b). For 
reference the moist adiabat for the warmest and coldest SST anomalies are 
included as dashed lines. The plot shows that relative amplification in the 
upper troposphere still occurs but with greatly increased variance relative to 
the mean. The plotted moist adiabats show that the profiles are still largely 
moist adiabatic, although for individual runs they can be up to 
\SI{0.5}{\kelvin} warmer or cooler than the moist adiabat. The increased 
variance also mostly occurs above \SI{600}{\hecto\pascal}. The variability in 
the temperature profiles may have consequences for the modelled interannual 
value of the land/ocean contrast. The control of tropospheric temperatures by 
the ocean surface is necessary for temperature anomalies to be communicated to 
land surfaces, and demonstrates that variations in SST may not directly 
correspond to tropospheric anomalies. We can look closer at the tropospheric 
amplification to determine the significance of the variations in the temperature 
profiles for small and large anomalies.

	Temperature anomalies relative to mean profile d) Moist convective heating 
rates, anomaly from the mean profile.}
\label{fig:scmsstinc_prof}
\end{figure}

The magnitude of the tropospheric amplification is more clearly shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:scmsstamp}. For this plot each anomalous temperature profile was 
divided by the SST anomaly used to create it. For example; taking the 
temperature profile created with an SST of \SI{30}{\degreeCelsius}, first the 
anomalous profile was created by minusing the median profile 
(\SI{26}{\degreeCelsius} profile), then the anomalous profile was divided by the 
anomalous SST, in this case the mean SST is \SI{26}{\celsius} so the anomalous 
SST value is \SI{4}{\celsius}.  This gives a ratio of amplification at each 
level, starting at unity at the surface and increasing to above 2 at 
\SI{300}{\hecto\pascal}.  In this way we get a measure of the amplification of 
the SST anomaly with height relative to the mean value.  A value of 2 at 
\SI{300}{\hecto\pascal} would indicates that a surface anomaly of 
\SI{1.5}{\kelvin} would lead to a \SI{3}{\kelvin} anomaly at that height.  

From Figure \ref{fig:scmsstamp} (a) we see that for large SST changes the 
positive anomalies (reds) show a larger amplification than the negative 
anomalies (blues), in addition the tropopause is higher for the positive 
anomalies leading to a difference at \SI{200}{\hecto\pascal}. The picture is 
much less clear in \ref{fig:scmsstamp} (b). There doesn't appear to be a 
significant difference between the positive and negative anomalies, however the 
overall values do seem to be similar at around 2-3. From these plots we can 
conclude that the amplification of surface temperature is fairly robust for a 
range of scenarios, for large SST anomalies there is greater amplification for 
warm anomalies, and there's a high level of variability for small SST anomalies.

In order to study the land surface temperature response to a tropospheric 
forcing a single column model allows us to vary parameters of the land surface 
properties while controlling the tropospheric forcing.  We begin by generating 
the temperature profiles above an ocean column by prescribing a range of SSTs 
and running the model to equilibrium.  The focus of our study is interannual 
variability, so we chose an SST value of \SI{26}{\degreeCelsius} as the mean 
profile -- which is appropriate for a tropical profile -- then the SST was 
varied by fractions of a degree above and below the mean value to simulate the 
magnitude of interannual variability. For these experiments we're not concerned 
with the rate of the land or ocean response so at each value the model was run 
to equilibrium, with the equilibrium value comparative to an annually averaged 
value from observations or a GCM.  In addition to these small SST changes the 
model was run with \SI{1}{\degreeCelsius} increments from 
\SI{19}{\degreeCelsius} to \SI{34}{\degreeCelsius}, to test the response of the 
model over a wide range of SSTs.

We have looked at the tropospheric temperature response to imposed SSTs in the 
single-column model. The model largely follows changes in the moist adiabat for 
relatively large SST changes, and for small difference that are comparable to 
interannual variability we see a large amount of variance but a similar 
tendency. The next step is to use these profiles above a land surface, and to do 
that we are going to utilise the Weak Temperature Gradient approximation.

\subsection{The Weak Temperature Gradient Approximation}
The Weak Temperature Gradient (WTG) approximation is used to parameterize the 
large scale tropical circulation. Due the small Coriolis force near the equator 
the tropical troposphere is unable to maintain strong temperature gradients, 
allowing areas of strong convection to control the tropical tropospheric 
temperatures.  The assumption we use is that the uniformity of tropospheric 
temperatures in the tropical band means that temperature profiles above land and 
ocean are controlled by convecting regions of the ocean. This allows us to use 
the profiles from an ocean column above land.

The single-column model can be run in WTG mode. In this mode a temperature 
profile is imposed in the free troposphere above a specified height, and the 
temperature below is able to adjust. Similar model setups have been used in a 
number of previous studies (e.g. \citealt{Sobel2000}, \citealt{Lintner2005}, 
\citealt{Ramsay2011}), although none have specifically looked at the land/ocean 
contrast.

\subsection{Values of land ocean contrast modelled with a single column model}
\label{sec:scmrlo}

We have discussed the temperature profiles above an ocean surface and introduced 
the WTG approximation which allows us to use these profiles above a land 
surface.  We can now look at the response of a land surface to the imposed 
temperature profiles, and subsequently calculate the modelled land/ocean 
contrast.  For the tropospheric forcing we will be using the temperature 
profiles created with SSTs that were centred on \SI{25.75}{\celsius} and varied 
in \SI{0.05}{\celsius} increments from \SIrange{25.00}{26.50}{\celsius}. These 
values were used to represent interannual variability. As mentioned, the height 
above which the temperature profile is fixed can be assigned, and is designated 
as PFixT (Pressure above which to Fix the Temperature profile).  The land 
surface is represented very simply by changing the evaporative fraction and 
using a small mixed layer depth.

Figure \ref{fig:scm_tlandsst} shows the SST anomalies (from the mean value of 
\SI{25.75}{\celsius}) plotted against the resulting $T_{land}$ anomalies 
(calculated from the mean value of $T_{land}$ for all SSTs) for three 
evaporative fractions and a PFitxT value of \SI{600}{\hecto\pascal}. The lines 
are the linear regressions between the SST and $T_{land}$. The regression lines 
are a useful visual representation of the regression coefficient, $R_{l/o}$, 
used to measure the interannual land/ocean contrast. The black dotted line is 
the one-to-one line; any regression line that is steeper implies an $R_{l/o}>1$.  
What we see are $R_{l/o}$ values greater than one, i.e. the land ocean contrast 
exists, and the steepness increases with decreasing evaporative fraction (drier 
surface). It should be noted for absolute temperatures we would also see the 
$T_{land}$ values increasing for drier surfaces, but we are concerned here with 
deviations around the mean. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{{land_anom_intvar_tsurf_p600}.eps}
\caption{The relationship between $T_{land}$ and SSTs, using anomalies, for 
three evaporative fractions of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7.}
\label{fig:scm_tlandsst}
\end{figure}


We now have a measure of the land/ocean contrast in the single column model, 
$R_{l/o}$, that we can compare with observations and GCM results, and we can use 
the simplified model to see what factors are controlling $R_{l/o}$. In Table 
\ref{tab:scmrlo} are values of $R_{l/o}$ for different evaporative fractions and 
PFixT values. Firstly, we note that the magnitudes of $R_{l/o}$ are comparable 
to the observational and GCM values seen in Table \ref{tab:allstats}. The 
single-column model's values range from 1.11 to 1.63, compared to observation 
and GCM tropical values of 1.19 to 1.35, or global values of 1.26 to 1.50.  
Deconstructing the value of $R_{l/o}$ somewhat, we can look at the values of the 
correlation of land/ocean temperatures and the ratio of standard deviations.  
Some of the single-column model results compare well to the observations and GCM 
tropical values, such as for an evaporative fractions of 0.5 the correlations 
are 0.77 to 0.79 and ratio standard deviations are 1.58 to 1.84, compare to 
obs/GCM correlations of 0.81 to 0.85 and ratio of standard deviations of 1.37 to 
1.48. This tells us that single-column model exhibits slightly higher difference 
  in the land/ocean variance, but overall the $R_{l/o}$ is a metric that is 
  comparable between the simple models and the observations and GCM results.

	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
\end{center}

Now that we have a metric to compare our simplified model with previous results 
we can begin to investigate the factors controlling the land/ocean contrast. In 
Table \ref{tab:scmrlo} two parameters have been tested; the evaporative fraction 
and PFixT. In contrast the value of PFixT does not show a consistent influence 
on $R_{l/o}$. It is possible that PFixT could influence the value of $R_{l/o}$; 
as the pressure at which the profile remains fixed decreases there is more 
potential for the temperature below this to vary.  That PFixT had no clear 
influence on $R_{l/o}$ implies the variation in temperature below the level of 
the fixed temperature profile is not being significantly impacted by the 
specifics of the model setup.  This is a positive outcome, as a dependence of 
$R_{l/o}$ on PFixT would indicate a dependence on a non-physical model 
parameter. Instead we see that we can simulate control of the tropical 
troposphere by tropical oceans and get robust values of $R_{l/o}$.
The evaporative fraction was found to be the strongest controlling factor of the 
value of $R_{l/o}$, in all scenarios a decrease in evaporative fraction lead to 
an increase in $R_{l/o}$.  


Overall the values of $R_{l/o}$ are within a realistic range, from 1.1 to 1.6.
Even for the very moist surface -- an evaporative fraction on 0.7 -- the values 
are similar the tropical values from observations ($R_{l/o, obs} =1.19$), and 
the ENSO-Slab run ($R_{l/o, enso} =1.17$), while the CMIP5 ($R_{l/o,cmip} 
=1.35$) and the AMIP run ($R_{l/o, amip} =1.26$) tropical values are closer to 
corresponding values for an evaporative fraction of 0.5. Looking at how the 
evaporative fraction is controlling the $R_{l/o}$ values we again deconstruct 
$R_{l/o}$ into correlation and ratio of standard deviation. It is primarily the 
ratio of standard deviation which is causing the increase in $R_{l/o}$ with 
decreasing evaporative fraction, as the correlation between the land and ocean 
columns doesn't change significantly.  Although we can't measure changes in the 
observation and GCM values of the ratio of standard deviation or correlation 
with changing surface moisture, we have seen that the tropical values are 
similar to the single column model, with correlation of around 0.8 and ratio of 
standard deviation of around 1.4.  The consistency of these statistics between 
the single column model and observations and GCMs are at least an indication 
that aspects of the relationship between the land and ocean are well represented 
by the single column model. 

The single column model results indicate a strong dependence of the magnitude of 
$R_{l/o}$ on surface moisture availability, modelled with evaporative fraction.  
This will be further explored by comparing the atmospheric profiles of 
temperature above ocean and land surfaces.


\subsection{Lower atmospheric response to a free tropospheric forcing}

We have seen that by using the WTG mode we can force a single-column model with 
tropospheric temperature profiles and model a land/ocean contrast, and it's 
magnitude is comparable to observations and GCMs and dependent on the dryness of 
the land surface.  We will now look at the atmospheric temperature profiles 
above land and ocean and compare the results to existing theories concerning the 
role of atmospheric lapse rates and the land/ocean contrast. The results below 
use a PFixT of \SI{600}{\hecto\pascal} and an evaporative fraction of 0.3. The 
low evaporative fraction (relative to 
0.5 or 0.7) resulted in larger deviations between the temperature profiles of 
the land and ocean columns, allowing for easier comparison. The results from 
other runs with different evaporative fractions and PFixT values were similar 
but of different magnitude.\\

\citet{Byrne2013a} outlined a mechanism for the global warming land/ocean 
contrast based on the height of the lifting condensation level (LCL). A 
schematic of the potential temperature ($\theta$) profile above land and ocean 
is shown in the Figure \ref{fig:bo_fig1}.  It demonstrates that in the free 
troposphere the temperature profiles above land and ocean follow the same moist 
adiabatic profile ($\Gamma_m^*$), and then a difference in LCL heights (i.e. the 
point where the profile flattens) results in a temperature difference between 
land and ocean. The difference is dependent on the saturated moist adiabatic 
lapse rate between the ocean and land LCLs. $\Gamma_m^*$ reduces when warming 
occurs, which \textit{increases} the temperature difference between land and 
ocean and creates a land/ocean contrast that exists in transient and equilibrium 
global warming scenarios. We can test the potential suitability of this theory 
for the warming and cooling of interannual variability by looking at profiles of 
potential temperature in the single column model.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{{byrne_ogorman_fig1}.png}\\
\caption{Figure 1 from \citet{Byrne2013a}. A schematic of the potential 
temperature}
\label{fig:bo_fig1}
\end{figure}

Looking now to the results of the single-column model, profiles of $\theta$ are 
shown in Figure \ref{fig:scmthprof} (a). The dashed lines are the profiles from 
the ocean column and the solid lines are the land column, and the colours 
correspond to the SST forcing. In the case of the land column, the colours 
represent which profile was imposed in the free troposphere. There is a fairly 
clear difference in the LCL height (\SI{950}{\hecto\pascal} for ocean, 
\SI{925}{\hecto\pascal} for land) over land and ocean which contributes to the 
absolute temperature difference between land and ocean, although we also see the 
land profiles diverging from the ocean \textit{above} the LCL. However the 
absolute difference in temperature is not what we are interested in, we are 
interested in how the change with warming and cooling is amplified over land.  
The important features are more clearly shown in Figure \ref{fig:scmthprof} (b), 
(c) and (d).

In order to see the change in the profiles, Figure \ref{fig:scmthprof} (b) shows 
the anomalous profiles, with the anomalies calculated relative to the mean of 
either all ocean or land columns. Once again the dashed lines are from the ocean 
column and the solid lines are from the land column. It would be expected that 
for the higher and lower land temperatures the profiles have larger anomalies 
than the ocean (i.e. it's comparable to the ratio of standard deviations seen in 
Table \ref{tab:scmrlo}) and plotting the anomalous profiles in this way allows 
us to see at which level the largest amplification is occurring.  The amount of 
variability between each individual run makes it difficult to see any clear 
tendencies, but there are dark blue (red) land profiles that are clearly more 
negative (positive) than the ocean column profiles used to force them. To 
clarify the picture all profiles were grouped in to five bins and the same 
analysis was done, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:scmthprof} (c) and (d). We 
essentially have a large positive/negative anomaly, small positive/negative 
anomaly and no anomaly.  

\begin{figure}[ht]

\SI{26.50}{\degreeCelsius} and the land has an evaporative fraction of 0.3}
\label{fig:scmthprof}
\end{figure}


According to the Byrne and O'Gorman theory there should be a change in the ocean 
column $\Gamma_m^*$ between the land and ocean LCL levels as the profile warms 
and cools. If this process was driving the change in the single column model the 
dashed ocean profiles in Figure \ref{fig:scmthprof} (d) would slope away from 
the zero point, i.e. the anomalies would increase with height, and the larger 
anomalies would slope more than the smaller anomalies. Importantly this would 
occur in between the land and ocean LCL levels, around \SI{950}{\hecto\pascal} 
to \SI{900}{\hecto\pascal}. The ocean profiles do slope away from zero, but not 
enough to explain the land/ocean contrast. The land (solid) profiles show where 
the amplification is occurring.  The largest change in the warmest and coolest 
profiles is occurring around \SI{950}{\hecto\pascal} to \SI{900}{\hecto\pascal}.  
This is due to an increase (decrease) in the height of the LCL with warming 
(cooling). The contrasting $\Gamma_m^*$ (above the LCL) and dry adiabatic lapse 
rate ($\Gamma_d$) (below the LCL) gradients means that a small change in the LCL 
over land leads to large change in the surface temperature. In addition the 
warmest and coolest land profiles also show a deviation away from the ocean 
column moist adiabat above the LCL, around \SI{900}{\hecto\pascal} to 
\SI{800}{\hecto\pascal}, which further amplifies the warming. Although the Byrne 
and O'Gorman theory of the land/ocean contrast was formulated for a global 
warming scenario, where the magnitude of warming is greater, this doesn't mean
it is not applicable to interannual variability. However we have modelled a 
land/ocean contrast with realistic statistics where it does not apply.
To further investigate the land response we will next look at the relationship 
between a range of variables and the surface temperature.



\subsection{Surface Temperature Relationships}

We have seen that while the atmospheric profile of the single column model shows 
some similarities to the global warming lapse rate theory described by 
\citet{Byrne2013a} but ultimately the mechanism appears to be different.  To 
understand the factors controlling the land surface temperature ($T_{land}$) of 
the single column model we will look at relationships between $T_{land}$ and a 
number of variables. 

In section \ref{sec:scmrlo} and Figure \ref{fig:scm_tlandsst} we saw the 
relationship between $T_{land}$ and the SSTs, where the SSTs were used in an 
ocean column to generate temperature profiles and the profiles were imposed in 
the free troposphere of a land column to force the surface temperatures.  The 
regression lines represented $R_{l/o}$ and showed the increase of $R_{l/o}$ with 
decreasing evaporative fraction.  A large amount of variability was evident in 
the response of $T_{land}$ to the imposed temperature profile, this is discussed 
further in section \ref{instability}.  Despite the variability,
when using different values of PFixT, domain size, vertical resolution and other 
parameters the model showed very similar relationships between $T_{land}$, SST 
and evaporative fraction. It is evident then that the SSTs are able to 
consistently influence $T_{land}$.

We will now look at how the SST-generated temperature profiles influence other 
variables in the land column, and how these variables relate to $T_{land}$.  We 
will be using anomalies for all variables and for the purposes of calculating 
the mean each evaporative fraction in the land column was treated as a separate 
run.  The SST is from the ocean column, all other variables are from the land 
column, forced with free tropospheric temperature profiles. Figure 
\ref{fig:scm_SSTVar} shows the relative humidity, longwave and shortwave 
radiation and precipitation plotted against the SST and $T_{land}$, with the 
correlation values listed in Table \ref{tab:scm_SSTVar}. A similar picture 
emerges for the four variables; the forcing SSTs have at best a very weak 
relationship with the variables in the land column, but there is a strong 
relationship between the variables and $T_{land}$. For example in Figure 
\ref{fig:scm_SSTVar} (a) we see a very weak relationship between SST and 
relative humidity, with the highest correlation being -0.41, then Figure 
\ref{fig:scm_SSTVar} (b) shows a strong relationship between relative humidity 
and $T_{land}$ with correlations from -0.68 to -0.93. Similar relationships are 
seen for longwave and shortwave radiation, and then precipitation has a weaker 
relationship with the surface temperatures. We are not proposing a causal 
relationship between the surface temperatures and the variables, but looking to 
understand how the imposed temperature profiles are influencing the land column.  
The relationships show that while the imposed profiles have a control on the 
surface temperature, as indicated by the correlations in Table \ref{tab:scmrlo}, 
there is a large amount of independent variability in the land column. The 
source of this variability, and its possible effect on the modelled land/ocean 
contrast will be investigated in the following section.

A defining feature in the results in Figures \ref{fig:scm_tlandsst} and 
\ref{fig:scmthprof} is the large amount of variability in the response of the 
land column, for this reason a discussion of the stability of the model is in 
order. Previously we have been looking at the equilibrium temperature, taken as 
the mean of the final 100 days. If we look instead at a timeseries of the 
surface temperature response we see that it demonstrates chaotic behaviour in 
the surface temperature. Timeseries for a range of tropospheric forcings and 
parameters are shown in Figures \ref{fig:scmts} (a)-(c). Some of runs forced 
with cooler temperature profiles show regular oscillations, it should be noted 
their is no diurnal cycle in the model.  For forcing with higher temperatures we 
often see a decoupling of the surface temperatures and the imposed temperature 
profile which results in a significant cooling of the surface temperature.  Both 
the oscillations and the instability are due to the interaction of clouds and 
radiation. This can be demonstrated as the interaction between the convection 
and radiation schemes in the model can be turned off. The resultant timeseries, 
shown in Figure \ref{fig:scmts} d), quickly reaches a stable equilibrium 
temperature and doesn't demonstrate the instability seen in a)-c). While the 
chaotic nature of this model setup, and the unpredictable interaction between 
convection and radiation, may seem undesirable it does result in realistic 
values of the land/ocean contrast. Removing the interaction severely damped the 
land column response, indicating a weakness in the ocean to land connection when 
using the WTG mode. This weakness is dealt with by directly coupling land and 
ocean columns in the following section.

\section{Zonally aligned rows of ocean and land columns}
\label{mech_mcm}

The single column model in weak temperature gradient mode offered a promising 
and novel approach to investigating the land/ocean contrast and the role of 
ocean forcing.  However, a few issues remained; the instability of the model 
under certain conditions has the potential to lead to unrealistic results, and 
disabling the interaction between the convection and radiation schemes damped  
the land response. In addition, the assumptions of the WTG approximation are 
only valid in the tropics, a limiting factor when attempting to explain the 
regional differences in the land response. In order to continue using the column 
model while avoiding these issues a multi column setup was used. Multiple 
columns can be coupled to each other in a zonal or meridional direction. In this 
section we primarily use a zonal alignment, a meridional alignment is discussed 
in section \ref{mech_compare}.\\
In the single-column model tropospheric profiles were generated with a range of 
SSTs in an ocean column, then used to force the free troposphere of a land 
column. For the zonal and meridional column rows the model is forced directly 
with SSTs in the ocean columns, and the troposphere and land surface responds to 
that. 

\subsection{Robust values of land/ocean contrast with varying model geometries}

The column model can be run with one or more ocean and one or more land columns 
in a zonal or meridional alignment. In the single-column model the interaction 
between clouds and radiation lead to instabilities, yet disabling the 
interaction caused a damping of the ocean signal over land and $R_{l/o}$ values 
near to unity. The cloud/radiation interaction was switched off when running the 
model as rows of ocean and land columns and in contrast to a single-column in 
WTG mode, in the multi column model imposed SSTs still lead to an amplified 
response over land. Overall the values of $R_{l/o}$ are lower than the single 
column model but they also show an robust increase $R_{l/o}$ with decreasing 
evaporative fraction.   

A number of different geometries of land and ocean columns were tested, with the 
resultant $R_{l/o}$ values shown in Table \ref{tab:tdm_Rlo}. The values of 
$R_{l/o}$ were largely insensitive to the number of either ocean or land 
columns, although a single ocean and single land column did produce a slightly 
higher $R_{l/o}$. As with the single-column a drier surface increases the 
amplification of the ocean signal over land. However the breakdown of $R_{l/o}$ 
into correlations and ratio of standard deviations we see a difference. The 
correlation values are all very close to one.

\subsection{Vertical structure and tropospheric response over land and ocean in 
the column model}

The single and multi column model was used with the purpose of understanding the 
vertical structure of the land/ocean temperature contrast. We can see from Table 
\ref{tab:tdm_Rlo} that when using small evaporative fractions we can reproduce 
the magnitude of $R_{l/o}$ seen in GCMs and observation. We will now compare the 
vertical structure and response of the column model with a GCM, specifically 
with results from the ENSO-Pacemaker experiments.  

Figure \ref{fig:tdm_regprof} uses the same technique as in Figure 
\ref{fig:linreg_plev}; the blue line is the regression coefficient between the 
temperature at each model level in the ocean column and the SSTs, the green line 
is the regression coefficient between the temperature at each model level in the 
land column and the SSTs. Figures \ref{fig:tdm_regprof} a) -- the multi column 
model and b) -- the GCM, have some key similarities and differences; the ocean 
profiles are both very similar, they feature the large amplification around 
\SIrange{200}{400}{\hecto\pascal} due to moist convection, as well as a local 
maximum at the freezing level at \SI{600}{\hecto\pascal}.  Comparing the 
profiles above land we see a large difference above \SI{500}{\hecto\pascal}. In 
the GCM the moist convective amplification is communicated above land areas but 
becomes damped whereas in the column model the two profiles follow each other 
closely.  This doesn't necessarily imply the presence of moist convection in the 
land columns, merely that the land and ocean are more tightly linked in the 
multi column model.  Allowing for this discrepancy the GCM and column model are 
very similar.  In the area above \SI{800}{\hecto\pascal} the land/ocean contrast 
disappears and below \SI{800}{\hecto\pascal} the land and ocean profiles diverge 
to give similar values of $R_{l/o}$.\\
From Figure \ref{fig:tdm_regprof} we can assume that there may be difference in 
the land surface response in the GCM and multi column model due to the 
discrepancy in the upper troposphere response, but importantly the lower 
atmospheric response is very similar, making the simplified model suitable for 
further investigation of the land/ocean temperature contrast and the role of 
ocean forcing.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Atmospheric profiles of temperature and relative humidity}

In section \ref{scm_prof} the atmospheric profiles of $\theta$ for the single 
column indicated that a changing LCL height over land as well as a deviation 
between land and ocean lapse rates above the LCL can lead to $R_{l/o}>1$. We 
will know look at profiles of $\theta$ in the multi column model. The potential 
importance of a changing LCL height motivated an increase in the vertical 
resolution of the model.  The grid was non-uniform with 85 levels, and a 
resolution of \SI{5}{\hecto\pascal} between \SIrange{980}{800}{\hecto\pascal} 
and \SI{10}{\hecto\pascal} between \SIrange{800}{650}{\hecto\pascal}, with the 
fine resolution preventing step changes in the height of the LCL.  Figure 
\ref{fig:tdm_prof} shows three temperature profiles from a run with an 
evaporative fraction of 0.05 and an $R_{l/o}$ of 1.13. The three profiles are 
the maximum, minimum and median SST forcing. The full profile is shown in (a) 
with a close up in (b). There are two features to look for; a change in the 
gradient of $\theta$ in the ocean column between the ocean LCL and land LCL as 
per the \citet{Byrne2013a} theory, and any significant change in the height of 
the LCL as seen in the single column model. There is some indication in the 
figure of a small change in the LCL over land and ocean but a change in gradient 
is difficult to determine.  Figure \ref{fig:tdm_dthdp} shows the vertical 
gradient of $\theta$, $D\theta/Dp$, to determine any significant features.  An 
increase in the magnitude of $D\theta/Dp$ (i.e. more negative) would indicate a 
flatter profile, and the height of the local minimum can indicates the location 
of the LCL. In Figure \ref{fig:tdm_dthdp}, the gradient of $\theta$ in the ocean 
column above the LCL becomes more negative with increasing SST which is the 
expected result according to the Byrne and O'Gorman theory.  However, there is 
also an unusual feature; from \SIrange{900}{800}{\hecto\pascal} the land profile 
is above, or cooler than, the ocean profile. This region of warmer ocean/cooler 
land could have the effect of dampening the value of $R_{l/o}$ and is not an 
expected feature.  To understand what is happening we will look at the profiles 
of relative humidity

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{{l3o1_prof_theta_ef0.05}.eps}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{{l3o1_prof_theta_ef0.05_close}.eps}
	\caption{Atmospheric profiles of theta in the multi model for forcing SST 
	values of \SI{24}{\degreeCelsius}, \SI{26}{\degreeCelsius and

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{{l3o1_prof_dthetadp_ef0.05_close}.eps}
	\caption{Profiles of $D\theta/Dp$ in the multi model in the land (solid) and 
	ocean (dashed) columns, showing the decrease in gradient (more negative) in 
the ocean column with warmer SST values} \label{fig:tdm_dthdp}
\end{figure}

Regarding the warmer ocean/cooler land profile from 
\SIrange{980}{800}{\hecto\pascal}, the profiles of relative humidity are quite 
telling. The relative humidity profile in Figure \ref{fig:tdm_rhprof} a) is from 
the same run as Figure \ref{fig:tdm_prof}, it has one ocean and three land 
columns. Two SSTs are plotted, the warmest and coolest of the runs, as the 
results are similar for a range of SSTs.  From the surface we see the much 
higher relative humidity over the ocean column then a sudden drop at around 
\SI{970}{\hecto\pascal}, to the extent that the ocean column becomes drier than 
the land columns. The dry region, from \SIrange{940}{800}{\hecto\pascal} 
coincides with the steeper $\theta$ lapse rate. As this run only has one ocean 
column and three land columns the region may be related to the model geometry.  
To test if the geometry is responsible for the dry region, we look at a run with 
three ocean and three land columns.  Figures \ref{fig:tdm_rhprof} (b)-(d) all 
show a similar drying in the ocean column, these are also focusing on the 
atmosphere below \SI{800}{\hecto\pascal}. There is a robust response with the 
three ocean and three lands, implying the drying is not a function of the 
geometry.  Figures \ref{fig:tdm_rhprof} (b), (c) and (d) show three difference
evaporative fractions, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.20. The evaporative fraction has a clear 
effect on the relative humidity in the land column, but the amount of drying in 
the ocean columns is largely insensitive to the evaporative fraction or relative 
humidity of the land columns. For example comparing Figure \ref{fig:tdm_rhprof} 
b), c) and d) which have evaporative fractions of 0.05, 0.10 and 0.20  
respectively, the near surface humidity in the land columns changes from 45\% to 
60\%, however the response of the ocean columns is very similar.  The difference 
in the dry region is at most 5\%.
To summarise, the atmospheric profiles of $\theta$ indicate the possibility that 
a change in the $\Gamma_m^*$ between the land and ocean LCL heights, as per 
\citet{Byrne2013a}, could contribute to the land/ocean contrast. However the 
lapse rate over the ocean is being affected by a strong drying from the land 
column, indicated in the relative humidity profiles. We will look at the 
circulation response in the model to further explore this.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{{l3o1_prof_rh_ef0.05}.eps}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{{l3o3_prof_rh_ef0.05_close}.eps}

	\caption{Atmospheric profiles of relative humidity in the multi column model, a) has

\label{fig:tdm_rhprof}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Circulation response in a row of columns}
To see what is causing the drying in the ocean columns we look at the vertical 
velocity, $\omega$ and circulation using the streamfunction $\psi$ of vertical 
and zonal velocities. There weren't any significant changes in the circulation 
for varying SSTs so for these variables we use the mean across a range of SSTs.  
The profiles of $\omega$ clearly shows the convection in the ocean columns -- 
positive values of $\omega$ -- which are balanced with sinking motion in the 
land columns.  The $\psi$ profile better demonstrates the flow in the model, and 
shows a low level circulation response. Positive values of $\psi$ indicate 
clockwise flow centered at \SI{850}{\hecto\pascal} in the ocean column nearest 
the land.  This circulation is responsible for transporting dry air from the 
land columns.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{{l3o3_omegal_ef0.05_meansst}.eps}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{{l85co2_psi_ef0.05_meansst}.eps}
	\caption{Circulation response in the multi column model, a) Omega (vertical velocity), 
	b) Psi (streamfunction of vertical and horizontal velocity).}
	\label{fig:tdm_circ}
\end{figure}

This circulation is influencing the atmospheric structure in the ocean column, 
but is it affecting the ocean's influence of the land column, and thus the value 
of $R_{l/o}$? This drying of the atmosphere above the ocean is not present in a 
large scale across the globe and therefore could be of concern when determining 
the suitability of this simplified model when comparing the results to GCMs or 
observations.  Figure \ref{fig:tdm_psi} (a)-(d) shows how the low level 
circulation scales with evaporative fraction. A drier land surface results in a  
stronger low level circulation.  Referring back to Table \ref{tab:tdm_Rlo}, 
$R_{l/o}$ increases with decreasing evaporative fraction. If the value of 
$R_{l/o}$ is related to the difference in lapse rates above land and ocean, 
which in turn is related to the difference in humidity, then a drying of the 
ocean column may lead to a smaller difference between the ocean and land 
columns.  Instead, we see that the magnitude of the reduction in humidity in the 
ocean columns is largely insensitive to the evaporative fraction (Figure 
\ref{fig:tdm_rhprof}) and while the strength of the low level circulation 
driving the reduced humidity increases with evaporative fraction, the value of 
$R_{l/o}$ still increases, implying that the drying of the ocean column is not 
significantly affecting the value of $R_{l/o}$, or more importantly, the ability 
of the simplified model to simulate the land/ocean contrast.

decreases.}

\subsection{Values of land ocean contrast for different evaporative fractions 
and latitudes}

We have seen that while the two-dimensional model has a low level circulation 
that dries the ocean column, it is still able to simulate aspects of the 
land/ocean contrast we see in GCMs (i.e. Figure \ref{fig:tdm_regprof}), and it's 
response to surface properties is expected from the lapse rate of theories of 
\cite{Joshi2007} and \cite{Byrne2013a}. We now extend the range of evaporative 
fractions and vary the latitudes to build a picture of the range of $R_{l/o}$ 
values.\\
The model had 3 ocean and 3 land columns and initially was run in a zonally 
orientated domain. At each latitude an appropriate mean SST value, solar zenith 
angle and Coriolis parameter were used.  The model was forced with a range of 
SSTs values which varied around the mean value for each latitude, and $R_{l/o}$ 
was calculated for each parameter.	The results, in Figure \ref{fig:tdm_Rlo} 
show the dependence of $R_{l/o}$ on evaporative fraction, but also a decrease 
with latitude, excepting the increase from \SI{0}{\degree} and \SI{10}{\degree}.  
The same experiments were also performed using a meridionally orientated domain, 
where the prescribed SST columns were nearer to the ``equator" and the land 
columns extended towards the poles.  In the meridional domain the values of 
$R_{l/o}$ show the same tendencies as in the zonal domain, but at first appear 
lower than the zonal domain. However, as each column spans \SI{5}{\degree} of 
latitude, if we take the $R_{l/o}$ values of a specific column and compare it to 
the corresponding latitude of the zonally orientated model we see they are quite 
similar, i.e. Figure \ref{fig:tdm_Rlo} (d). When looking at the nearest 
corresponding latitudes in (a) and (d), e.g. \SI{40}{\degree} in (a) and 
\SI{45}{\degree} in (d) the values of $R_{l/o}$ are very similar.  The reduction 
in the $R_{l/o}$ with increasing latitude could be due to reduced transport 
across the domain. The latter is evident in Figure \ref{fig:tdm_Rlo} c), which 
shows the mean relative humidity in the land columns. The gradient of relative 
humidity along a constant latitude due to varying evaporative fraction is clear, 
and increasing relative humidity corresponds to decreasing $R_{l/o}$ as 
expected.  The relative humidity also decreases with increasing latitude, due to 
reduced transport of moisture from the ocean columns, further discussed below.  
For the gradient of relative humidity across latitudes, decreasing relative 
humidity is associated with decreasing $R_{l/o}$, the inverse of the 
relationship with a constant latitude.  This indicates that the value of 
$R_{l/o}$ is a not only a function of evaporative fraction but is also dependent 
on transport from ocean columns to land columns.\\

\section{Comparison of Simplified Models and GCM results}
\label{mech_compare}

The large range of $R_{l/o}$ values allows for a direct comparison to GCM 
results. Using the pacemaker experiment we can calculate an $R_{l/o}$ value for 
each individual land grid box, see Figure \ref{fig:tdm_gcm_compare} a). We do 
this by comparing the grid box surface temperature of with either the mean 
tropical SSTs, mean global SSTs or zonally averages SSTs corresponding to the 
latitude of the grid box. The latter may seem most appropriate for comparing to 
the zonally orientated multi column model, however the tropical Pacific forcing 
of the pacemaker experiment meant that a grid box $R_{l/o}$ calculated using 
mean tropical SSTs gave the most reasonable results.\\
The next step is to generate a comparative map using the multi column column model 
results. For each GCM grid box we find the latitude and evaporative fraction, 
then we take the $R_{l/o}$ from the multi column model run with corresponding parameters, 
see Figure \ref{fig:tdm_gcm_compare} b).  For example, for a point in central 
Australia at a latitude of \SI{23}{\degree} and evaporative fraction of 0.2 we 
use the $R_{l/o}$ from the multi column model at latitude \SI{20}{\degree} and evaporative 
fraction 0.2 and assign that grid box a value of 1.12, thereby building a global 
map of the expected land surface temperature response based on the results of 
the two dimensional column model.\\
The two-dimensional model required very low evaporative fractions to elicit an 
$R_{l/o}>1$, lower than would be required from a GCM or expected from 
observations. As such we wouldn't expect the magnitudes the generated $R_{l/o}$ 
response map to perfectly match a similar GCM map. However, if the multi column model was 
capturing a significant mechanism of the land/ocean temperature contrast, that 
is, the oceans control the tropospheric temperature and the drier land surface 
affects the mean lapse rate, then we might expect the broad patterns to be 
similar between the multi column model and GCM results. It is clear that the two plots in 
Figure \ref{fig:tdm_gcm_compare} share little resemblance in magnitude or 
patterns.\\
The only two large regions of the generated map with an $R_{l/o}>1$ are Saharan 
Africa and central Australia, and yet in both these regions the pattern of the 
land response differs from the GCM. For example, in Saharan Africa the generated 
map shows a very consistent $R_{l/o}$ from western coast of Africa to the 
Persian gulf, as this region is of a similar dryness. In contrast, the GCM 
results only have an $R_{l/o}>1$ for the western half of the region. Likewise in 
south-eastern Australia the GCM has a higher $R_{l/o}$ whereas the multi column model has 
lower values for that region. Another area of interest is tropical South 
America, here the GCM has high $R_{l/o}$ values and a distinctive pattern with a 
very high "blob" over the Amazon basin, none of which is present in the multi column 
model.\\
This result may be seen as an indication that the simplified radiative 
convective model is inadequate in modelling the land/ocean contrast, but the 
model does capture some theoretical aspects as expected. Therefore if we 
consider the differences between the two maps in Figure 
\ref{fig:tdm_gcm_compare} as indicative of the processes missing from the simple 
model, we can use this as a guide to understanding the regional response of the 
land surface to an ocean forcing.

\label{fig:tdm_gcm_compare}
\end{figure}

An obvious process missing from the multi column model results in Figure 
\ref{fig:tdm_gcm_compare} is the interaction between clouds and radiation. This 
can lead to chaotic results but clearly might still be important. The plot from 
Figure \ref{fig:tdm_Rlo} was repeated but with the interaction between clouds 
and radiation turned on. The plot in Figure \ref{fig:tdm_Rlo_ic} is broadly 
similar in terms of the evaporative fraction, in that a drier surface tends to 
have a higher $R_{l/o}$.  The tendency of $R_{l/o}$ with latitude is different, 
we don't see a reduction with increasing latitude.  The main feature, however, 
is the randomness present in the results.  It seems at certain latitudes the 
model behaves strangely, namely at \SI{10}{\degree} where values are very low 
and \SI{40}{\degree} where they are very high. It is clear that a map created 
using these results would contain inconsistencies.

In Figure \ref{fig:tdm_Rlo} c) we saw that relative humidity decreased with 
increasing latitude, and this was associated with a decreasing $R_{l/o}$. It was 
theorized that the reduction in relative humidity coincided with decreased 
transport from the ocean to the land columns, which then resulted in a lower 
$R_{l/o}$. We will now look at the circulation response with latitude to 
understand the changes. As the latitude increases there is clear change in the 
circulation. At low latitudes the model is essentially one cell, with rising air 
over the ocean columns and sinking over the land. This begins to break down at 
\SI{20}{\degree} and by \SI{30}{\degree} smaller cells have formed between each 
column. This will reduce the transport of heat and moisture from the ocean 
columns to the land columns, resulting in the reduced relative humidity and 
reduced values of $R_{l/o}$ seen with increasing latitude.

\section{Mechanisms of the Regional Response}
\label{mech_greb}

In our investigations with the single column and multi column models we found 
that the modelled land/ocean contrast compared well to the mean global and 
tropical values from observations and GCMs in terms of both the statistics and 
the vertical structure. In the column model there was a robust dependancy of the 
value of $R_{l/o}$ on the dryness of the land surface, which is controlled 
through the evaporative fraction. The value of $R_{l/o}$ in the multi column 
model also had a dependence on latitude. When the column model results were 
compared to regional values from a GCM there were large discrepancies.  While 
the dryness of the surface certainly contributes to the land/ocean contrast in 
the GCM results, it does not control the magnitude of the regional response. 
There are many continental regions where SST signals become amplified that 
cannot be explained by the column model.

In this section we are going to continue to investigate the land/ocean contrast 
by focusing on the regional response of land to an ocean forcing. We define the 
regional scale as continental to sub-continental, with different regions loosely 
defined by a pattern or similarity of response in a certain area. To investigate 
this regional response we use the Globally Resolved Energy Balance model (GREB 
model)  to recreate the patterns of temperature response seen in the 
ENSO-Pacemaker experiments.  

\subsection{GREB Model - Deconstructing the regional response}

The GREB model and the ENSO-Pacemaker experiments were chosen for a few specific 
attributes. In the GREB model the prognostic variables are the surface 
temperature, atmospheric temperature, upper ocean temperature and atmospheric 
water vapour, all calculated on a global grid \citep{Dommenget2011}. The aspect 
of the GREB model that is most useful for this work is that the boundary 
conditions include meridional and zonal winds, surface wetness fraction, and 
cloud cover.  The ocean surface temperature can either be assigned, or a 
responsive slab ocean can be used.  Starting with climatological values, 
anomalies can be added to these variables to recreate, for example, the 
atmospheric conditions during the time of the peak land response to an ocean 
forcing. In addition, the anomalies can be added to one variable individually, 
or in any combination to build a picture of the response, and determine the 
important factors for each region.

We have a versatile, globally resolved model that we can use to build a picture 
of the regional response of land surface, but we need a suitable way to force 
the model. For this, we used the ENSO-Pacemaker experiments. The regular and 
repetitive forcing in the ENSO-Pacemaker experiment allows for composites to be 
easily made for the period of maximum and minimum land response.  As we are 
interested in the land surface response, the composites consist of six months of 
the maximum (or minimum) response over land. The land response is delayed by 
around 3 months from the peak ocean forcing (as outlined in section \ref{xcor}) 
so the composite is the mean of months 0 to 6 after the peak ocean forcing in 
the Pacific Ocean. 

The GREB model experimental setup for this section has three key parts; a) 
Composites of anomalies of soil moisture, SSTs, meridional winds, zonal winds, 
and cloud cover are created from the ENSO-Pacemaker experiments, using months 0 
to 6 after the peak forcing.  A composite of land surface temperature is also 
generated to compare to the GREB results, b) The anomalies from these composites 
are applied to the climatological boundary conditions in the GREB model.  
Anomalies for each of the variables listed above are added individually then in 
combination, and for each anomaly or combination of anomalies the GREB model is 
run to equilibrium, c) The surface temperatures from each GREB equilibrium run 
are compared against the composite surface temperature from the ENSO-Pacemaker 
run, in order to determine which variables are the important on regional or 
global scales.

\subsubsection{Composite temperature response from the ENSO-Pacemaker 
experiment}

Before investigating the experiments with the GREB model we will look at the 
surface temperature response in the ENSO-Pacemaker experiment, essentially, the 
response we wish to recreate with the GREB model.  Figure \ref{fig:comp_temp} 
are the composites of months 0 to 6 after the maximum warming (a) and maximum 
cooling (b) of the Pacific Ocean forcing. The colour-bar for the cooling is 
reversed to allow comparison of the two figures. Both the response patterns and 
the magnitude of warming and cooling are similar, implying the response is 
fairly linear, although in some regions the warming forcing warms more than the 
cooling forcing cools.  The area with the greatest discrepancy and a difference 
in the sign of the surface temperature response are the high northern latitudes 
of Europe and Asia, which is also the region most removed from the area of 
forcing.  Other features true to both plots include a positive (i.e.  warming or 
cooling in same direction as forcing) response in tropical South America, with a 
strong amplification in the Amazon basin, a distinctive pattern across Africa, 
with a positive response everywhere except the north eastern region. High 
latitude North America has a strongly amplified positive response in both plots.  
The negative responses in the subtropical regions of South America and north 
eastern Africa are similar but weaker in the cooling scenario. Overall we see a 
positive response over most land surfaces, with some specific patterns of 
negative response, and some areas show a significantly increased amplification 
to the ocean forcing.

peak forcing. Positive forcing on left (a), negative on right (b).}
\label{fig:comp_temp}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Composite anomalies from the ENSO-Pacemaker experiment}

Figure \ref{fig:comp_5var} shows the composite anomalies from the ENSO-Pacemaker 
experiments which will be used as boundary conditions in the GREB model. These 
are the composites for the maximum positive forcing resulting from a warming in 
the tropical Pacific Ocean. 

In Figure \ref{fig:comp_5var} (a) the cloud cover anomalies show a large 
increase in cloud cover above the forcing region in the tropical Pacific, as the 
heating from the ocean leads to convective clouds.  This is matched with a 
decrease in cloud north and south in the subtropics, and also the to east and 
west, above tropical South America and the Maritime continent. The surface 
wetness fraction response, although weak, corresponds to the cloud cover 
response in most regions, with reduced cloud cover leading to drying (negative 
values) and increased cloud cover leading to moistening (positive values). This 
is seen most clearly in South America, where drying in the Amazon basin 
corresponds to reduced cloud, and moistening around \SI{30}{\degree} south is 
associated with increased cloud cover. However the opposite is seen in North 
America, where an increase in soil moisture is associated with a decrease in 
cloud cover. 

The meridional wind anomalies, in Figure \ref{fig:comp_5var} (b), show distinct 
wave patterns in the extra-tropics and high latitudes, indicated by alternating 
positive (southerly) and negative (northerly) anomalies. Although the dynamics 
of the extra-tropical response is not a focus of this study, the distinctive 
extra-tropical wave pattern concurs with theory on the atmospheric response to a 
tropical heat source (e.g. \citealt{Hoskins1981}, \citealt{Sardeshmukh1988}, 
\citealt{Held1989}).  There is convergence in the tropical Pacific, with northerly 
anomalies to the north of the forcing region and southerly anomalies to the 
south. The largest response is in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean, with a strong 
northerly anomaly.  Figure \ref{fig:comp_5var} (d) shows that the zonal wind 
anomalies are strongest in the Pacific Ocean basin, and there is a strong 
positive (westerly) anomaly in the tropical Pacific on the equator, which is 
what would be expected for an El Ni\~no like forcing.  Moving away from the 
equator, there are alternating bands of westerly and easterly wind anomalies.

The tropical Pacific Ocean forcing is clearly seen in the SST anomalies, in 
Figure \ref{fig:comp_5var} (e). Away from the forcing region there is a 
consistent warming throughout the tropics, and a number of regions in the 
mid-latitudes show a cooling response.

To summarise; the composites of winds, clouds, surface wetness fraction and SST all show 
both negative and positive response to the tropical Pacific Ocean forcing, and 
all have large regional differences. In the next section the composite anomalies 
will be used in the GREB model.

\clearpage

\subsubsection{Imposing SST anomalies}

We begin the GREB experiments by looking at the land surface temperature 
response to imposed SSTs, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:greb_sst}. The anomalous 
SSTs field -- the composite from the ENSO-Pacemaker experiment -- is applied to 
the climatological SSTs and the model is run to equilibrium. The SST field 
includes the forcing region in the tropical Pacific and the response of the 
ACCESS slab ocean in the other oceans.  The first thing we note is that the 
amplification of SST signal in the land surface temperatures is not present, as 
it is in the ACCESS model in Figure \ref{fig:comp_temp}, yet the regionality of 
the land response is similar to ACCESS. The majority of warming is in the 
tropical band, following the SST anomalies.  Regarding the lack of amplification 
over land; there are a number of atmospheric processes not present in the GREB 
model which we will explore these further by imposing other anomalous fields, 
but from our previous work we know the importance of the tropospheric structure 
and convection. These are not directly modelled in GREB but are represented 
through an imposed cloud climatology. There are also no changes to the 
circulation, the effect of which we will explore by imposing wind anomalies. So 
we see imposing SST anomalies without  adjusting other factors influencing the 
climate leads to warming over land, but not the amplification we see in ACCESS.

	\caption{Surface temperature response in GREB to imposed SST anomalies.}
\label{fig:greb_sst}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Imposing zonal and meridional winds anomalies}

In Figure \ref{fig:greb_uv} we see the surface temperature response to imposed 
zonal (a), meridional (b) and combined (c), \SI{850}{\hecto\pascal} wind 
anomalies. These runs used climatological values for clouds and surface wetness 
fraction with a responsive slab ocean. The anomalous winds were added to the 
climatological winds and the model was run to equilibrium.  Figure 
\ref{fig:greb_uv} (a) shows the zonal wind anomalies lead to a small but 
consistent warming in many areas, with the only large region of cooling in the 
north west Pacific. There are no clear similarities with the temperature 
response in Figure \ref{fig:comp_temp}.  The surface temperature response to 
meridional wind anomalies in Figure \ref{fig:greb_uv} (b) shows some more 
interesting response patterns. Anomalous poleward winds in the northern Indian 
Ocean and South China Sea increase heat transport to continental Asia, resulting 
in a large warming. Similarly , in the south-eastern Pacific Ocean and the high 
latitudes of North America, anomalous poleward winds lead to warmer 
temperatures. There is warming across much of the tropics, land and ocean, with 
the exception of the western Pacific where there is a large cooling from the 
tropics to both poles.  Most of the temperature response can be explained by 
considering the heat transport of the anomalous winds (i.e. Figure 
\ref{fig:comp_5var} (b)), and the mean surface temperature climatology of the 
model, Figure \ref{fig:greb_clim}.  In Figure \ref{fig:greb_uv} (c) the 
meridional and zonal wind anomalies are both applied to the climatological 
winds, then the model is run to equilibrium. The areas with a strong positive 
response to the meridional winds still show a warming, such as the south-eastern 
Pacific and North America, however there is a much finer structure to the 
response.

With Figures \ref{fig:greb_uv} (a), (b) and (c) we can begin to explain features 
of the surface temperature response of ACCESS in Figure \ref{fig:comp_temp} (a).  
The response patterns which the anomalous winds successfully recreate include the 
curved pattern in north-east Pacific and large North American warming, as well 
as the band of cooling just north of the forcing area in the Pacific. There is 
an indication of warming and cooling pattern over northern Africa. It is more 
evident in the run with only meridional wind anomalies, as the zonal anomalies 
reduce the cooling in north east Africa, but certainly the shape of the pattern 
is similar.  The surface temperature response in the ACCESS model over Asia is 
more complicated, with a mix of warming and cooling, whereas in the GREB model 
there is a uniform warming. The GREB model response over Australia for the 
meridional winds is a cooling instead of a warming. The cooling is reduced for 
the combined meridional and zonal wind anomalies but it is still incorrect.  
Overall, applying only the anomalous winds from ACCESS to the GREB model results 
in many areas showing similarities in the surface temperature response. It is 
important to remember that no additional heating was used in these runs, the 
surface temperature response is due to a redistribution of heat within the mean 
climate.

\end{figure}
\clearpage

\subsubsection{Imposing cloud cover anomalies}
For the next experiment, composites of anomalous cloud cover from the 
ENSO-Pacemaker experiments were applied to the cloud climatology in the GREB 
model, with the resulting surface temperature response shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:greb_cld}. Climatological winds and surface wetness, and a slab ocean 
were used. Firstly we note the that the anomalous cloud cover elicits a large 
surface temperature response over both land and ocean.  Applying the cloud 
anomalies over the ocean is likely to result in very different SST values than 
those seen in the ENSO-Pacemaker, especially over the forcing area.  The 
tropical Pacific Ocean forcing resulted in an increase in convection, and hence 
clouds, over the warmest SSTs. In the GREB model an increase in clouds primarily 
leads to a cooling due to decreased incoming shortwave radiation. This can be 
seen most clearly in the forcing region in the tropical Pacific where there is a 
large amount of cooling in the GREB model, compared to Figure 
\ref{fig:comp_temp} (a) which shows warming.  Likewise at latitude 30S and 
longitude 180W-120W a warming in the GREB model due to decreased cloud 
corresponds to a cooling in the ENSO-Pacemaker experiment.  However, this is not 
a consistent feature and oceans such as the tropical Atlantic from latitudes 
30S to 30N show warming and cooling in the GREB model in an area of consistent 
warming in the ENSO-Pacemaker experiment.

Our main interest is the response over land areas and how it compares to Figure 
\ref{fig:comp_temp}. The response in the GREB model over South America is 
largely consistent. There is warming in the tropical regions and a cooling at 
latitude 30S. The ACCESS model has a warming at the southern tip of the 
continent which isn't present in GREB, however the cooling there is much weaker 
than at 30S.  Both models show a large scale warming in tropical South America, 
however the pattern of warming is different. The peak warming in the GREB model 
is in the west, whereas the ENSO-Pacemaker experiment is more uniform except for 
a small region on the equator in the east with increased warming not seen in 
GREB.  Over North America the GREB model captures the regions of warming (north) 
and cooling (south) with a reduced magnitude of warming compared to ACCESS. In 
the GREB model there is a warming response over Australia with a gradient from 
north to south that is similar to ACCESS, except that the GREB response has a 
cooling across southern Australia.  There are large discrepancies across 
northern Africa, Europe and Asia, as the GREB model has a large scale cooling 
that is not seen in ACCESS. An exception is in South East Asia and eastern 
China, where to the east of the Tibetan Plateau both models show a similar 
warming pattern. 

On a global scale the response of the GREB model to the anomalous clouds doesn't 
show an obvious land/ocean contrast. Some regions respond with the opposite sign 
to the ENSO-Pacemaker experiment that the cloud forcing is from, yet others 
regions show similarities with distinctive patterns of surface warming and 
cooling.  Compared to the response to imposed winds, imposed clouds also explain 
many of hte regional patterns but often with a greater magnitude.


\begin{figure}[ht]

	\caption{Surface temperature response in GREB to imposed cloud cover 
	anomalies.}
	\label{fig:greb_cld}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Imposing Surface wetness fraction anomalies}

In our next experiment we use anomalies of surface wetness fraction from the 
ENSO-Pacemaker experiments, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:greb_smc}. As expected a 
reduction in surface wetness leads to an increase in surface temperature, 
however we note that the surface temperature response is small compared to the 
clouds and wind anomalies.  The largest response is on the Tibetan Plateau, this 
is most likely due unrealistic model behaviour for this area of unusually high 
topography. It is in South America where we see similarities between the GREB 
and ACCESS surface temperature response (Figure \ref{fig:comp_temp}), not 
necessarily in the magnitude but in the shape of the response.  On the equator 
in the east of tropical South America is the area that shows the strongest 
temperature response in the ENSO-Pacemaker experiments in ACCESS, it doesn't 
show up in the GREB cloud or wind response experiments, but can be seen to warm 
in the surface wetness fraction response experiment.  Likewise the GREB model 
exhibits a cooling to the south at latitude 30S, longitude 60W which is similar 
to that seen in ACCESS.  Away from South America there's no obvious similarities 
between the response of the two models.

The magnitude of the surface temperature response depends on the magnitude of 
the surface wetness anomalies, which themselves are a calculated value that is 
open to interpretation. The surface wetness fraction in each gridbox is 
calculated from the soil moisture, for both the GREB climatology and the 
anomalous forcing.  To calculate the surface wetness fraction from the soil 
moisture, the latter which is in units of \si{kg/m^2}, an appropriate maximum 
value of soil moisture is chosen and then all values are divided by this maximum 
value to find the surface wetness fraction, i.e.  $surface\ wetness\ fraction = 
\frac{soil\ moisture}{maximum\ soil\ moisture}$.  The maximum value is not the 
absolute global maximum but rather a representative maximum value, since an 
unusually high absolute maximum in one gridbox would skew all the results. A few 
maximum values were looked at, as well as different methods of aggregating the 
months used to create the composite of soil moisture (i.e. using maximum or 
minimum gridbox values). It was found that the magnitude of the response in GREB 
changed, but the sign and the patterns of response were robust to different 
methods of the calculating surface wetness fraction. This should be considered 
when interpreting the results seen in Figure \ref{fig:greb_smc}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{{t_surf.smc.pos.4ycomp.response.thesis}.eps}
	\caption{Surface temperature response in GREB to imposed surface wetness	
	anomalies.}
	\label{fig:greb_smc}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{GREB response to combined anomalies}

We have presented the surface temperature response to individually applied 
anomalies, and seen some patterns of the surface temperature response in ACCESS 
recreated in GREB model. We will now present the surface temperature response in 
the GREB model to combinations of anomalous fields. Figure \ref{fig:greb_uv_sst} 
shows the surface temperature response to imposed meridional and zonal winds and 
SST anomalies. Comparing the results of the experiment with only wind anomalies 
and a slab ocean, Figure \ref{fig:greb_uv} (c), while the imposed meridional and 
zonal winds resulted in many similarities between the ACCESS and GREB results 
there were a few areas with a response of the wrong sign, namely over Australia, 
southern South America, some parts of Asia. Once the SST anomalies are imposed 
with the wind anomalies the errors over Australia and South America are 
corrected.  The anomalous winds resulted in a cooling over Australia, then with 
the addition of SSTs this changed to a warming. South America had a uniform 
warming, the SSTs resulted in a cooling at 30S. Central Asia still shows a large 
warming which is not seen in ACCESS. So while in many regions, such as Africa 
and North and South America, some of the response seen in ACCESS can be 
explained by the redistribution of heat, whereas over Australia the anomalous 
winds are distributing heat from the anomalous SSTs. Similarly, the run with 
only SST anomalies (Figure \ref{fig:greb_sst}) requires circulation changes to 
distribute the surface temperature anomalies.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{{t_surf.uv_sst.pos.4ycomp.response.thesis}.eps}
	\caption{Surface temperature response in GREB to imposed wind and SST 
	anomalies.}
\label{fig:greb_uv_sst}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:greb_allnosst} we see the surface temperature of the GREB 
model with all anomalous forcing except for the SSTs, i.e. anomalous meridional 
and zonal winds, surface wetness fraction and clouds, with a responsive slab 
ocean. In this model run there is no direct thermal forcing, yet there is a 
large warming across the land areas in the tropics, somewhat matched by a 
cooling over the oceans. The addition of winds and surface wetness anomalies 
improves the GREB surface response relative to ACCESS. Compared to the 
experiment with only cloud forcing there are increases in the magnitude of 
warming over North and South America and Africa, warming in Asia and a decrease  
in the cooling over North Africa and Asia. The response over the ocean in GREB 
is also improved with the addition of wind anomalies. With only clouds there was 
a warming on the equator in the Indian and Atlantic oceans, the anomalous winds 
increase the warming response poleward and lead to patterns of warming similar 
to those seen in ACCESS in Figure \ref{fig:comp_temp} (a). This shows that even 
without the additional heating of the atmosphere, changes in wind and clouds due 
to a ENSO-like forcing can lead to remote tropical warming.


\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{{t_surf.all.pos.4ycomp.response.thesis}.eps}\\
	\caption{Surface temperature response in GREB to imposed wind, cloud cover 
	and surface wetness anomalies.}
\label{fig:greb_allnosst}
\end{figure}

The regions which still exhibit a large sign error when comparing Figures 
\ref{fig:greb_allnosst} and \ref{fig:comp_temp} (a) are northern Africa and 
Europe. In Figure \ref{fig:greb_all} the anomalous SST field from the 
ENSO-Pacemaker experiments is added to the clouds, winds and surface wetness 
anomalies. With this addition we see a reduction in the cooling. These regions 
warmed with the meridional and zonal wind anomalies and including anomalous SSTs 
made the pattern closer to that seen in ACCESS, so in the GREB model the cooling 
due to clouds and warming due to advection cancel each other out. It is 
interesting to note that the Sahara region of Africa is the area where the 
multi-column model successfully predicts the response of ACCESS yet the GREB 
model does not. We can incorporate large scale dynamics into the GREB model by 
imposing anomalous fields from the ENSO-Pacemaker experiment and simulate the 
response seen in ACCESS in many areas, but the GREB model doesn't have the 
vertical complexity of the column model. The inconsistency between GREB and 
ACCESS -- and the multi-column model -- in this region may indicate the vertical 
structure of the atmospheric column is important in very dry regions, but large 
scale dynamics dominate in other regions.

% \section{Mechanisms of the Extra-Tropical Response}
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Relationship between land and ocean very different in extra-tropics.
% 	\item Discuss Barsugli, Battitsi atmospheric forcing of SST anomalies.
% 	\item Largest discrepancies between models and observations exist in 
% 		extra-tropics.
% 	\item Changes in cloud cover, winds induced by tropical SSTs can impact 
% 		extra-tropics, i.e. pacemaker and GREB model results.
% 	\item COWL - COld Ocean, Warm Land theory...
