\section{Introduction}
% \paragraph{Discuss GW theories, relevance to interannual var.}
In chapter \ref{evidence} we showed evidence for the interannual land/ocean 
temperature contrast in observations and models, and discussed its magnitude and 
spatial extent. Through AMIP simulations it was shown that an $R_{l/o}>1$ can 
exist in a model forced only with SST variability. The implication is that the 
variability from the ocean is being amplified over the continents. By 
prescribing SSTs we remove the effect of ocean heat capacity - and it's ability 
to cause $R_{l/o}>1$ by damping the ocean's response relative to the land 
response for a uniform forcing. In this chapter we will attempt to determine the 
underlying mechanisms responsible for the amplification of ocean surface 
temperature anomalies over land. A range of sensitivity experiments using the 
ACCESS, MIT RCE and GREB models will be presented.  The analysis of observations 
and models from chapter \ref{evidence} also demonstrated that the ability of the 
ocean to influence land temperatures is geographically inhomogenous. There is a  
latitudinal dependence, and this will guide the initial investigations of this 
chapter.

\section{The Influence of Tropical Oceans on Land}

When looking at the relationship between $T_{land}$ and SSTs there is an 
assymetry between the response of $T_{land}$ to tropical and extra-tropical SST 
forcing. We investigate this assymetry and the importance of the tropical oceans 
in regulating regional and global land surface temperatures using modelling 
experiments. In the 1K experiments a constant +/-1K SST anomaly is applied to 
tropical or extra-tropical regions, in the Half-AMIP experiments the same 
regional restrictions are used but instead of a constant forcing, variability is 
imposed using observed SST anomalies. The Pacemaker experiments are forced with 
an idealised ENSO in the tropical Pacific and a slab ocean or fixed SSTs 
elsewhere.

\subsection{1K Experiments}

Figure \ref{fig:1K} shows the surface temperature response (control removed) 
from the 1K experiments; where 1K was added to the oceans in the tropics, 
extra-tropics or globally. In response to a tropical SST perturbation there is a 
large tropical response, greatest over equatorial South America and Africa, 
India and the maritime continent (Fig.\ref{fig:1K} a). The tropical 1K ocean 
perturbation leads to $T_{land}>+1$K in most tropical areas. Thus the SST 
forcing is amplified. The extra-tropical land the response to the tropical 
forcing is not significant everywhere, but some regions also show an amplified 
response to the tropical SST forcing (e.g. central Asia and parts of Europe and 
North America).  An extra-tropical $T_{land}$ response to tropical SSTs is seen 
for seasonal averages in the winter months of each hemisphere, the Northen 
Hemsiphere winter response is shown in Figure \ref{fig:1K} e.

When looking at the annual mean response of $T_{land}$ to extra-tropical SST 
perturbations there is little significant response, however for seasonal 
averages both hemispheres show a significant response in their respective winter 
months, shown for the Northern Hemisphere in Figure \ref{fig:1K} e-g. The 
response of $T_{land}$ is also amplified in some regions relative to the initial 
perturbation.  However, the extra-tropical forcing again leads to a weaker land 
response than the tropical forcing, as was also found in the AMIP simulations.  
Also similar to the AMIP simulations we again find that the  global SST forcing 
has a bigger impact than the tropical only forcing for the annual mean. In 
addition the response of the global SST forcing is greater than the 
superposition of the tropical and extra-tropical forcing (comparing 
Fig.\ref{fig:1K} c and d).  This again indirectly suggests that the 
extra-tropical SST forcing does lead to a significant land response.

\subsection{Half-AMIP Experiments}

In Figure \ref{fig:ftest} f-tests are used to measure the increase in annual 
temperature variability due to SST variability at the surface and at the 300hPa 
pressure level relative to a simulation with fixed SST climatology. Figure  
\ref{fig:ftest} a) and d) show that global SST variability has a substantial 
impact on the tropical atmospheric and surface temperature variability. In the 
extra-tropical regions the impact is much weaker, but still statistically 
significant in some regions.

In order to separate the influence of the tropical SST variability from that of 
the extra-tropical SST, we repeat the AMIP experiment forced with the historical 
SST variability just in the tropics or just in the extra-tropical regions. The 
impact of the tropical-only SST variability is similar to the global SST 
variability, with a clear and strong impact in the tropical regions.  The AMIP 
simulation with extra-tropical-only SST variability has only a very weak to no 
impact on the regional (grid-box scale) atmospheric and surface temperature 
variability.  However, if we compare the global AMIP versus the tropical only 
AMIP run we still can see a somewhat larger increase in variance over land in 
the global AMIP run. This indirectly suggests that the extra-tropical SST 
forcing does play a role, although it is much smaller than the tropical forcing.  
In summary the AMIP experiments suggest a clear tropical SST forcing to the 
atmospheric and land surface temperatures, but a much weaker or no forcing from 
the extra-tropical SST.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Tropical Troposphere}
The Half-AMIP experiments demonstrate an important process in the strong 
tropical land/ocean connection. Figures \ref{fig:ftest} d)--e) show the value of 
an f-test on the 300hPa surface, measuring the increase (values above zero) in 
temperature variability due to imposed SST variability. The results for global 
and tropical AMIP runs are very similar, with the global AMIP having slightly 
higher values in the tropics and some more variability in the extratropics, 
whereas there's no significant tropospheric response to extra-tropical SSTs.  
The tropospheric response in the tropics can be described with two key 
processes; the large amplitude of the temperature variability is due to latent 
heating by deep moist convection, and the -- largely -- zonally uniform pattern 
is the result of the tropical free troposphere not being able to maintain 
horizontal pressure gradients due the small coriolis number (REF). This results 
in tropical SST perturbations being amplified in the troposphere and efficiently 
transported over tropical land. The area with the largest tropospheric anomalies 
is over the eastern tropical pacific, the ENSO region. ENSO is the dominant 
driver of interannual temperature variability and while the ENSO induced 
tropospheric anomalies are distributed around the tropics, there is still a 
maximum in that area. The role of ENSO is further explored with the Pacemaker 
experiments.

\subsection{Pacemaker Experiments}\label{pacemaker}

On inter-annual timescales ENSO is the most significant global climate driver. 
It is therefore remarkable that in the analysis of the CMIP5 model simulations 
the NINO3 region did not show up with a high correlation to global $T_{land}$ 
(see Fig.\ref{fig:cmip_cormap}). The ENSO region in the tropical Pacific has a 
lower correlation with $T_{land}$ than adjacent regions and the other ocean 
basins. Using the combined monthly mean CMIP5 surface temperature anomalies, 
Fig.\ref{fig:xcor} e) shows the lagged correlations between NINO3 SST and global 
$T_{land}$. The NINO3 region is seen to lead global land by 4 months.  Typically 
land has a fast response time to forcings, which would not result in a 
4 month delay, so this result suggests that the full land response is not 
directly forced by the NINO3 SST but is most likely caused by something else. 
This other forcing may be delayed to the ENSO variability by about 4 months. 
Since we have seen in Fig.\ref{fig:cmip_cormap} that global $T_{land}$ is highly 
correlated to other tropical ocean SST, it seems likely that $T_{land}$ is 
linked to the slower ocean response in the remote tropical oceans and not 
directly to the NINO3 region.

To address this question we conducted a series of idealised ENSO-response 
experiments. In the first experiment we prescribe an oscillating ENSO pattern (a 
regression between NINO3 and SSTs shown in Fig.\ref{fig:regpat}) in the tropical 
Pacific and a fixed 12 month climatology of SSTs elsewhere.  The oscillation 
period of the ENSO signal is 4 years, peaking in January. In the second 
experiment we allow SST variability outside the tropical Pacific simulated by a 
simple slab ocean model with a mixed layer depth of 50 metres.  Thus, in the 
second experiment the global ocean SSTs can respond to the oscillating ENSO 
pattern forcing.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{{regpat}.eps}\\
	\caption{Pattern used in ENSO experiments. Result of regression between NINO3 
	and global SST.}
	\label{fig:regpat}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Delayed Response}
Figure \ref{fig:xcor} (i-l) shows cross-correlations from the ENSO-FIXSST and 
ENSO-Slab forcing experiments. In i) and j) we see that for the fixed SST 
experiment the global and tropical land responds to the ENSO-like forcing (red 
line), and does so without the delay seen in Figure \ref{fig:xcor} e). When a 
slab ocean is introduced the land responds with a realistic delay of around 4 
months.  The peak slab ocean response is at 6 months, implying that the land is 
responding immediately to the initial Pacific ocean forcing and then 
subsequently to the delayed slab ocean response. The delayed land response is 
also associated with a higher correlation to the NINO3 region. Comparing the 
global and tropical averages, the main difference is the magnitude of the peak 
correlation, but in the tropics the slab ocean also results in the peak land 
correlation being higher than the peak ocean correlation. So the delayed 
response of the remote tropical oceans to a Pacific ocean forcing explains both 
the delayed land response and some part of the amplification of the oceanic 
temperature signal over land. In the extra-tropics there is only a very weak 
influence of the ENSO forcing on land temperatures in the sensitivity 
experiments (Fig.  \ref{fig:xcor} g, h), and the tropical Pacific has little 
influence on the slab ocean in the extra-tropics. The observations and CMIP5 
models also don't show a significant relationship between the extra-tropics and 
NINO3 (Fig.\ref{fig:xcor} g,h,k,l).

To summarise thus far; we see that tropical SSTs strongly influence tropical and 
- to a lesser extent - extra-tropical continental temperatures; SST anomalies 
are amplified in the tropical troposphere and efficiently transported over land; 
ENSO is the dominant source of interannual variability and can influence land 
surface temperatures via the troposphere. However we now wish to investigate the 
process by which SST variability leads to amplified $T_{land}$ variability.

\section{The Lapse Rate Mechanism}

In section ..., there was an indication that there might be similarities between 
the global warming and interannual land/ocean contrast. Figure ...  showed 
homogenous temperature response in the troposphere, and no land/ocean contrast 
at higher levels, with an amplified response at the land surface. This is 
similar to the warming lapse rate mechanism described by \citet{Joshi2007} and 
\citet{Byrne2013a}. These theories were originally devised to explain the 
land/ocean warming contrast that exists in global warming scenarios. However, 
the observed similarities justify testing the validity of the lapse rate 
theories in interannul variability.

We will begin by explaining the two theories, their similarities and 
differences. Then we look at the vertical structure of the atmospheric resposne 
in ACCESS, using the Pacemaker experiments. These results then motivate the use 
of a single-column and zonally or meridionally aligned multi-column model. The 
simplified models allow a greater control of the properties of the troposphere 
and the surface, finally we put the simplified model results into context by 
comparing them to ACCESS.

	\item explain Byrne O'Gorman theory
	\item Explain differences

\end{itemize}


\subsection{The tropopheric response in the Pacemaker Experiments}

We are going to use the Pacemaker experiments to test the relationship between 
the land and ocean surfaces and the troposphere above them. We first take a look 
at the vertical structure of the atmosphere in ACCESS and the relationship 
between land and ocean temperatures by comparing the Pacemaker experiment with a 
climatology run (i.e. no SST variability).  Using tropical averages, Figure 
\ref{fig:linreg_plev} shows regression values for the $T_{tropos}$ at different 
pressure levels as a function of the surface temperature $T_{land}$ (a) and 
$T_{ocean}$ (b), with the green line for the column of air above tropical land, 
blue for the column of air above tropical ocean, and the black line is the 
column above the remote tropical ocean, essentially the tropical oceans with the 
area of forcing removed.  Looking first at Figure \ref{fig:linreg_plev} a), in 
the simulation without any SST variability (dashed lines) the higher level 
tropical temperatures over land areas are not related to $T_{land}$ as the 
regression values between the surface and tropospheric temperatures falls to 
zero above \SI{800}{\hecto\pascal}, indicating that the atmospheric internal 
$T_{land}$ variability (independent of SST variability) is limited to the near 
surface layers and is not strongly related to the upper free $T_{tropos}$. In 
the simulation with SST variability the tropospheric temperature shows a strong 
relationship with the surface $T_{land}$ variability at all levels. 

Now focusing on Figure \ref{fig:linreg_plev} b), a distinctive feature for the 
troposphere above oceans (blue line) is the large increase in the regression 
values in the upper troposphere. This is a well known signature of moist
convection; a \SI{1}{\kelvin} anomaly at the surface corresponds to a 
\SI{2}{\kelvin} anomaly in the upper level temperatures, due to the latent heat 
release by moist convection (\citet{Joshi2007}, \citet{Byrne2013}, 
\citet{Dommenget2009}, etc.). The anomalies above land regions don't reach the 
same peak in the upper troposphere, however in the middle troposphere, around 
the \SI{700}{\hecto\pascal} to \SI{500}{\hecto\pascal} level, the two lines 
coincide, similar to the level in the atmosphere described by \citet{Joshi2007} 
where there is no land/ocean warming contrast. It's in the levels below 
\SI{800}{\hecto\pascal} where the variability increases above land. This figure 
would indicate a value of $R_{l/o}$ of around 1.2, as for a \SI{1}{\kelvin} 
anomaly of $T_{ocean}$ we have a \SI{1.2}{\kelvin} response in $T_{land}$.  

As we saw in section \ref{pacemaker} the remote oceans are important in the 
timing and magnitude of the continental land ENSO response, so we will now 
discuss their response to the Pacific ocean forcing. An advantage of the 
Pacemaker experimental design is that the area of ocean forcing is very well 
constrained.  In contrast, when using observations or coupled models to look at 
the response to an ENSO forcing the remote tropical oceans will also have their 
own, potentially considerable, internal variabiltiy due to ocean dynamics.  In 
the Pacemaker experiment the remote slab oceans have no dynamics or internal 
variability.  Therefore, we can consider the Pacific Ocean an external forcing 
to both the continental regions and the remote oceans, and measure the seperate 
response of land and ocean.  In Figure \ref{fig:linreg_plev} b) the black line 
is a measurement of the atmospheric response above remote oceans, the only 
variability for this region is imposed via the Pacific ocean forcing.  The 
remote tropical response is similar to the land response in shape; it also lacks 
the large amplification in the upper troposphere indicating that the upper 
levels are responding to the Pacific forcing and not being driven by their own 
moist convection.  At all levels the response above the remote tropical oceans 
is damped when compared to the land response which means there is no clear level 
where there is no land/ocean contrast however the two lines diverge more near 
the surface, with the largest difference between the gradients of the 
temperature profiles below \SI{800}{\hecto\pascal}.  In the global warming lapse 
rate theory, the steeper near-surface continental lapse rate is due to reduced 
moisture availability and thus lower relative humidities. It would appear that a 
similar process is active on interannual timescales with an additional factor; 
the tropospheric profile above a region of the ocean that is responding to an 
external forcing -- or a forcing from a seperate ocean basin -- will be 
potentially be damped throughout the entire troposphere.  The vertical structure 
above land and ocean is further explored with a one and two-dimensional model.

\label{fig:linreg_plev}
\end{figure}

We have a seen a similarity between the Joshi theory and the interannual 
response. This shows the mechanism appears active in the statistics of the 
Pacemaker experiment, now we want to explore this further. To investigate the 
physical mechanisms we will use a simpler model, one that we can limit the 
variables to discern the important physical mechanisms that control the response 
we have seen.

\section{Tropospheric and surface response to ocean forcing in a Single-Column 
Model}
\label{mech_scm}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Why do we use a single column model?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item We can control tropospheric forcing
			\item we can control land surface properties
			\item High vertical resolution
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

We have seen in the pacemaker experiments a distinctive response in the 
troposphere above land and ocean areas. The temperature profiles above land and 
ocean appear consistent with the lapse rate mechanism outlined by 
\citet{Joshi2007} and \citet{Byrne2013}. For this section we will use a 
single-column model to analyse the tropospheric response to an SST forcing, and 
the land surface response to a tropospheric forcing.\\
To understand how the physical processes occur we first look at how the 
atmosphere responds in the ocean column to SST variations, and then investigate 
the impact of tropospheric temperature changes on the land surface 
temperature.\\
We use a single-column model for three main reasons: the idealised nature of the 
model allows us to impose a tropospheric temperature profile, thus simulating a 
tropospheric temperature forcing; we can control the land surface properties; 
and we can increase the vertical resolution of the model which will prove useful 
when testing the finer details of the differences between the Joshi and Byrne \& 
O'Gorman theories.\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item How do we use it?
	\item Generate tropospheric temp profiles above an ocean
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Use a mean value appropriate for the tropics
			\item Vary SSTs above and below the mean value and run to 
				equilibrium
			\item Each SST value equivalent to an anomalous annual temperature
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

There are two main parts to the experimental setup; i) the ocean forcing of the 
troposphere, and ii) the tropospheric forcing of a land surface. For part i) we	 
generate temperature profiles in an ocean column which are to be used in part 
ii). To generate the profiles we begin with a mean SST suitable for the tropical 
band, generally around \SI{26}{\degreeCelsius}. We vary the SST above and below 
the chosen mean value, and for each SST value we run the model to equilibrium, 
in this way we end up with a range of temperature profiles varying around a mean 
value, and when comparing the results to observations or GCMs we consider each 
SST value to be equivalent to a yearly temperature. A full discussion of the 
generation of tropospheric temperature profiles in the ocean column is in 
section \ref{trop_response_ocean}.

\begin{itemize}
		\item Use the weak temp gradient to impose generated profiles above land
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Fix the free tropospheric temperature profile above a set 
			pressure level
		\item Run model to equilibrium for each temperature profile
		\item Allow near surface profile, and surface temperature, to 
			respond to free tropospheric profile
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Once we have generated the tropospheric temperature profiles above an ocean the 
next step is to use them as a forcing above a land surface. For this we utilise 
the Weak Temperature Gradient approximation, both in terms of the theoritcal 
basis for imposing a tropospheric profile, and in practical terms. The 
single-column model has a weak temperature gradient mode, which allows the 
tropopsheric temperature profile to be imposed above a certain height.


\begin{itemize}
	\item Compare the land and ocean columns to calculate the land ocean 
		temperature contrast.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Compare the SST used to generate a profile, with the land 
				surface temperature which results from imposing that profile 
				above it.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

Now we will look in detail at the response of the atmosphere in the ocean 
column.

\subsection{Tropospheric response to imposed SSTs in a single column}
\label{trop_response_ocean}

For each bit:
Ask yourself Qs
How does it relate to the introduction?
How do I explain this to past Nick?
How does it relate, reinforce the conclusions?

\begin{itemize}
	\item What are we doing: Examine at ocean column temperature profiles
	\item Why: See how well they align to theory, large/small anomalies
	\item Does model show upper tropospheric amplification due to moist 
		convection (i.e. moist adiabat)
	\item Compare small and large anomalies
	\item Large anomalies follow moist adiabat
	\item Small anomalies show more variability in profiles
	\item Quantify upper tropospheric amplification
	\item Look at convective heating profile, which confirms upper trop 
		amplification due to convective heating.
	\item Summary: Single column model shows upper atmospheric amplification, 
		due to moist convection (i.e. profiles are moist adiabatic), but show 
		variability for small difference in SST.
\end{itemize}

Before we begin our land surface response experiments we must generate the 
tropospheric temperature profiles above an ocean surface. By looking at 
temperature profiles as we vary the SST about an average tropical value we can 
test the model response against the expected theoretical response. We chose an 
SST value of \SI{26}{\degreeCelsius} as the average profile, which is 
appropriate for the tropics. For this section we look at both small and large 
anomalies from a chosen mean value; large anomalies test the robustness of the 
model and small anomalies are more appropriate for modelling interannual 
variability.

In Figure \ref{fig:scmsstprof_large} a) we see the temperature profile for a 
wide range of SST values. For each profile the model has been run to 
equilibrium, and an average of the last 100 days is taken. The difference 
between the profiles with increasing and decreasing SST values is more clearly 
shown in Figure \ref{fig:scmsstprof_large} b). For this plot the mean profile 
was calculated using all values from \SIrange{19}{33}{\degreeCelsius}, and then 
the mean profile was subtracted from each individual profile to give the change 
relative to the mean. For example, with the run forced with 
\SI{33}{\degreeCelsius}, at the surface the temperature is \SI{7}{\kelvin} 
warmer than the mean, and at \SI{200}{\hecto\pascal} the profile is 
approximately \SI{14}{\kelvin} warmer. This amplification of surface anomalies 
with height is the consequence of the profile being close to moist abiabatic, as 
expected in convecting regions of the tropics. The amplification above the ocean 
surface is also important in the communication of SST anomalies from oceans to 
land. From this plot it appears the model is behaving according to theory, but 
we can confirm that by plotting the moist adiabats.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{enso_tempprof_abs.eps}

\caption{a) Temperature anomaly relative to mean profile for SSTs from 
\SI{19}{\degreeCelsius} to \SI{34}{\degreeCelsius} b) Amplification relative to 
the mean profile c) Temperature anomalies relative to mean profile d) Moist 
convective heating rates, anomaly from the mean profile.}
\label{fig:scmsstprof_large}
\end{figure}

We can compare the model response with theory by including the moist adiabat, as 
seen in Figure \ref{fig:scmsstprof_ma}. The moist adiabat is calculated for each 
SST, then as with the model response the anomalies are taken relative to the 
mean of the mosit adiabats for all SSTs. We see that that model follows the 
moist adiabat closely from \SIrange{1000}{600}{\hecto\pascal}, after which they 
diverge slightly with the model showing less amplification. From this we can 
conclude that for a wide range of SST values, and for large differences in SST 
of \SI{1}{\kelvin}, the troposphere in the ocean column is largely moist 
adiabitic.  We can now compare this to the smaller variations in SST used to 
model interannual variability.

\caption{a) Temperature anomaly relative to mean profile for SSTs from 
\SI{19}{\degreeCelsius} to \SI{34}{\degreeCelsius} b) Amplification relative to 
the mean profile c) Temperature anomalies relative to mean profile d) Moist 
convective heating rates, anomaly from the mean profile.}
\label{fig:scmsstprof_ma}
\end{figure}

The temperature profiles in Figure \ref{fig:scmsstinc_prof} showing small 
changes in SST values don't reveal anything unexpected, as any differences are 
too small to discern at this scale. The profiles are similar to 
\ref{fig:scmsstprof_large}a) with the exception that there is little change in 
the height of the tropopause for small SSt changes. As with Figure 
\ref{fig:scmsstprof_large} b) the anomalous profiles were calculated using the 
mean of all SSTs, the result is Figure \ref{fig:scmsstinc_prof} b). For 
reference the moist adiabat for the warmest and coldest SST anomalies are 
included as dashed lines. The plot shows that relative amplification in the 
upper troposphere still occurs but with greatly increased variance relative to 
the mean. The plotted moist adiabats show that the profiles are still largely 
moist adiabatic, although for individual runs they can be up to 
\SI{0.5}{\kelvin} warmer or cooler than the moist adiabat. The increased 
variance also mostly occurs above \SI{600}{\hecto\pascal}. The variability in 
the temperature profiles may have consequences for the modelled interannual 
value of the land/ocean contrast. The control of tropospheric temperatures by 
the ocean surface is necessary for temperature anomalies to be communicted to 
land surfaces, and demonstrates that variations in SST may not directly 
correspond to tropospheric anomalies. We can look closer at the tropospheric 
amplification to determine the significance of the variations in the temperature 
profiles for small and large anomalies.

\end{figure}

The magnitude of the tropospheric amplification is more clearly shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:scmsstamp}, which measures the amplification of the SST anomaly with 
height relative to the mean value.  For example, a value of 2 at 
\SI{300}{\hecto\pascal} indicates that a surface anomoly of \SI{1.5}{\kelvin} 
would lead to a \SI{3}{\kelvin} anomaly at that height.  It shows that positive 
and negative anomalies are amplified to a similar extant, although the 
tropopause is higher for the positive anomalies leading to a difference at 
\SI{200}{\hecto\pascal}.

\label{fig:scmsstamp}
\end{figure}

In order to study the land surface temperature response to a tropospheric 
forcing a single column model allows us to vary parameters of the land surface 
properties while controlling the tropospheric forcing.  We begin by generating 
the temperature profiles above an ocean column by prescribing a range of SSTs 
and running the model to equilibrium.  The focus of our study is interannual 
variabilty, so we chose an SST value of \SI{26}{\degreeCelsius} as the mean 
profile -- which is appropriate for a tropical profile -- then the SST was 
varied by fractions of a degree above and below the mean value to simulate the 
magnitude of interannual variability. For these experiments we're not concerned 
with the rate of the land or ocean response so at each value the model was run 
to equilibrium, with the equilibrium value comparitive to an annually averaged 
value from observations or a GCM.  In addition to these small SST changes the 
model was run with \SI{1}{\degreeCelsius} increments from 
\SI{19}{\degreeCelsius} to \SI{34}{\degreeCelsius}, to test the response of the 
model over a wide range of SSTs.

The tropospheric response and the amplification of surface anomalies due to 
moist convection is shown in Figure \ref{fig:scmsstprof}.  In 
Fig.\ref{fig:scmsstprof} a) and c) the temperature anomalies relative to the 
mean profile show the amplification with height of both positive and negative 
SST anomalies for small increments and 1K changes in SST. Comparing a) and c) 
also demonstrates the difference between small increment changes in SST (c) 
which are relative in magnitude to interannual variability, and \SI{1}{\kelvin} 
increments, and while the former shows much greater variation between the 
profiles the general pattern is still clear and similar to a).  .  Figure 
\ref{fig:scmsstprof} c) demonstrates that the upper tropospheric anomalies are a 
result of heating by moist convection. Plots of the heating due to dry 
convection (not shown) show uniform heating rate throughout the troposphere.

\subsection{The Weak Temperature Gradient Approximation}
If we consider the tropical tropospheric temperature to be largely controlled by 
the ocean surface temperature then we can use a single column model to study the 
land/ocean temperature contrast by utilising the Weak Temperature Gradient (WTG) 
Approximation. The WTG approximation was introduced in Chapter \ref{intro_wtg}, 
and it is use in the single column model as a way to parametize the large scale 
circulation.
Initially a range of temperature profiles are generated in an ocean column with 
varying SSTs, then those profile can be imposed above a land surface.  In a 
single column with a land surface the temperature profile is relaxed towards the 
imposed profile in the free troposphere and allowed to vary near the surface, 
thereby simulating the control of the free tropospheric temperatures by, for 
example, Pacific ocean anomalies.

\subsection{Lower atmospheric response to a free tropospheric forcing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Look at how the temperature profile responds to the imposed profiles 
		and compare to ocean profiles.
	\item Test if changes in lapse rate with warmer/colder SSTs corresponds to 
		predicted changes according to Joshi or O'Gorman theory.
	\item Findings:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Variations in ocean column lapse rate with warming/cooling 
				insignificant, doesn't fit with O'Gorman theory
			\item Changing height of LCL in land column with warming and cooling 
				corresponds to amplified land surface temperatures.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

We will now look at the atmospheric temperature profiles, focusing on one set of 
runs from the single column model. The run with a PFixT (pressure above which 
the temperature profile remains fixed) of \SI{600}{\hecto\pascal} and 
evaporative fraction of 0.3 was chosen because the low evaporative fraction 
resulted in larger deviations between the temperature profiles of the land and 
ocean columns allowing for easier comparison. The results from other runs were 
similar but of different magnitude. \\
\citet{Byrne2013a} outline a mechanism for the global warming land/ocean 
contrast based on the height of the lifting condensation level (LCL), as 
discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:logw}. A schematic of the potential temperature 
($\theta$) profile is shown in the Figure \ref{fig:bo_fig1}. It demonstrates 
that due to a difference in LCL heights the temperature difference between land 
and ocean is dependent on the saturated moist adiabatic lapse rate 
($\Gamma_m^*$), and as $\Gamma_m^*$ reduces with warming, the difference between 
land and ocean increases.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{{byrne_ogorman_fig1}.png}\\
\caption{Figure 1 from \citet{Byrne2013a}. A schematic of the potential 
temperature}
\label{fig:bo_fig1}
\end{figure}

Comparing this to the profile of $\theta$ in Figure \ref{fig:scmthprof} a) we 
see some similarity in the mean profile (the black line), due the different LCL 
heights, but it is clear that the land profile diverges from the ocean column 
$\Gamma_m^*$ above the LCL.  According to the Byrne and O'Gorman theory there 
should be a change in the ocean column $\Gamma_m^*$ between the land and ocean 
LCL levels as the profile warms and cools, but no significant change is shown. 
The changes are more easily seen in Figure \ref{fig:scmthprof} c) and d). For 
this figure the SST values were grouped into five mean values with the intention 
of showing the evolution of the change away from the mean value. If $\Gamma_m^*$ 
between the land and ocean LCLs were controlling the land/sea contrast then the 
warmest and coolest anomalous ocean column (dashed) profiles in 
\ref{fig:scmthprof} d) would be seen to flatten from \SI{950}{\hecto\pascal} to 
\SI{900}{\hecto\pascal}, instead they are mostly vertical. The land (solid) 
profiles show where the amplification is occuring.  The largest change in the 
warmest and coolest profile is occuring around \SI{950}{\hecto\pascal} to 
\SI{900}{\hecto\pascal}. This is due to an increase (decrease) in the height of 
the LCL with warming (cooling). The contrasting $\Gamma_m^*$ and dry adiabatic 
lapse rate ($\Gamma_d$) gradients means that a small change in the LCL over land 
leads to large change in the surface temperature. The warmest and coolest land 
profiles also show a significant deviation from the mean above the LCL, around 
\SI{900}{\hecto\pascal} to \SI{800}{\hecto\pascal}.

\subsection{Values of land sea contrast modelled with a single column model}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How do we generate $R_{l/o}$ values?
	\item Demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:scm_tlandsst}
	\item What is controlling values?
	\item Surface moisture, controlled through evaporative fraction
	\item Pressure at which profile is fixed does not control $R_{l/o}$
\end{itemize}

Parameter testing was discussed in Chapter \ref{methods} in relation to the 
stability of the model. Here we will discuss parameters affecting physical 
processes, with some results shown in Table \ref{tab:scmrlo}. The simplicity of 
the model means the properties of the land surface are primarily controlled by 
the evaporative fraction. By considering the evaporative fraction as a measure 
of soil moisture the results can be related back to observations and GCM 
results.  The evaporative fraction was found to be the strongest controlling 
factor of the value of $R_{l/o}$, in all scenarios a decrease in evaporative 
fraction lead to an increase in $R_{l/o}$. When using the model in WTG mode it 
is possible to adjust the pressure at which the temperature profile remains 
fixed (PFixT).  It would seem likely that this would influence the value of 
$R_{l/o}$; as the pressure at which the profile remains fixed increases there is 
more potential for the temperature below this to vary.  However it was found 
that PFixT had no clear influence on $R_{l/o}$, implying the variation in 
temperature below the level of the fixed temperature profile is not being 
significantly impacted by the specifics of the model setup. This is a positive 
outcome, as a dependance of $R_{l/o}$ on PFixT would indicate a dependance on a 
non-physical model parameter. Instead we see that we can simulate control of the 
tropical troposphere by tropical oceans and get robust values of $R_{l/o}$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{{land_anom_intvar_tsurf_p600}.eps}
\caption{The relationship between $T_{land}$ and SSTs, using anomalies, for 
three evaporative fractions of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7.}
\label{fig:scm_tlandsst}
\end{figure}


Overall the values of $R_{l/o}$ are within a realistic range, from 1.1 to 1.6.
Even for the very moist surface -- an evaporative fraction on 0.7 -- the values 
are similar the tropical values from observations ($R_{l/o, obs} =1.19$), and 
the ENSO-Slab run ($R_{l/o, enso} =1.17$), while the CMIP5 ($R_{l/o,cmip} 
=1.35$) and the AMIP run ($R_{l/o, amip} =1.26$) tropical values are closer to 
corresponding values for an evaporative fraction of 0.5. We can compare the 
comparitave variability and co-variability of the land and ocean columns by 
looking at the ratio of standard deviation and the correlation between the 
columns. It is primarily the ratio of standard deviation which is causing the 
increase in $R_{l/o}$ with decreasing evaporative fraction, as the correlation 
between the land and ocean columns, which is around 0.7, doesn't change 
significantly. Although we can't measure changes in the observation and GCM 
values of the ratio of standard deviation or correlation with changing surface 
moisture, we can see that the tropical values are similar to the single column 
model, with correlation of around 0.8 and ratio of standard deviation of around 
1.4, see Table \ref{tab:rlo}.  The consistency of these statistics between the 
  single column model and observations and GCMs are at least an indication that 
  aspects of the relationship between the land and ocean are well represented by 
  the single column model. The single column model results also indicate a 
  strong dependance of the magnitude of $R_{l/o}$ on surface moisture 
  availability.

\subsection{Variability and instability - Role of convection}
\label{instability}

\begin{itemize}
	\item We see large variability in surface temperature response
	\item Timeseries of surface temperatures over land is chaotic
	\item Most likely due to interaction of radiation and convection schemes, 
		demonstrated by showing timeseries with that interaction turned off.
\end{itemize}


Given the large variability in $T_{tropos}$ and the weak connection between the 
imposed temperature profile and variables associated with convection such as 
cloud fraction, a discussion of the stability of the model is in order. The 
timeseries in Figure \ref{fig:scmts} a)-c) demonstrate a range of chaotic 
behaviours in surface temperature. For many runs forced with a cooler 
temperature profile we see regular oscillations, it should be noted their is no 
diurnal cycle in the model.  For forcing with higher temperatures we see a 
decoupling of the surface temperatures and the imposed temperature profile which 
results in a lower surface temperature from a higher forcing temperature.  The 
oscillations and the instability are due to the interaction of clouds and 
radiation. This is demonstrated as the interaction between the convection and 
radiation schemes in the model can be turned off. The resultant timeseries, 
shown in Figure \ref{fig:scmts} d), quickly reaches a stable equilibrium 
temperature and don't demonstrate the instability see in a)-c).

\subsection{Surface Temperature Relationships}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How is the ocean column (via the imposed profile) controlling the land 
		surface temperature?
	\item Look at relationship between SST in the ocean column and variables in 
		the land column.
	\item SST has only a very weak relationship with RH, no relationship with 
		SW, LW, cloud fraction.
	\item In contrast, RH, LW, SW related to surface temperature in land column, 
cloud fraction weakly related.
\end{itemize}

To understand the factors controlling the land surface temperature $T_{land}$ of 
the single column model we will look at relationships between $T_{land}$ and a 
number of variables, beginning with $T_{land}$ verse the SST used to generate 
the imposed temperature profile, shown in Figure \ref{fig:scm_tlandsst}. The 
regression lines represent $R_{l/o}$ and show the increase of $R_{l/o}$ with 
decreasing evaporative fraction.  A large amount of variability is also evident 
in the response of $T_{land}$ to the imposed temperature profile, this is a due 
to the interaction between clouds and radiation and is discussed further in 
Chapter \ref{instability}.  Despite the variability, model runs with different 
values of PFixT, domain size, vertical resolution and other parameters show 
similar relationships between $T_{land}$, SST and evaporative fraction.

Looking now at how the SST generated temperature profiles influence variables in 
the land column, and how those variables correlate with $T_{land}$; Figure 
\ref{fig:scm_SSTVar} shows the anomalous SST plotted against the anomalous 
values of relative humidity, longwave and shortwave radiation and cloud 
fraction.  The SST is that used to generate the imposed temperature profile and 
the variables are from the land column. The correlation values are listed in 
Table \ref{tab:scm_SSTVar} and there are few significant relationships between 
the forcing SSTs and the land column variables. Table \ref{tab:scm_SSTVar} shows 
that the relative humidity is partially related to the SST forcing, although the 
highest correlation is still only -0.41, and no other correlations are above 
0.30. In contrast there are clear relationships between the relative humidity, 
longwave and shortwave radiation and cloud fraction and $T_{land}$. So we see 
that while the imposed temperature profiles have a high correlation with the 
resultant surface temperatures in the mean values, as shown in Table 
\ref{tab:scm_rlo}, variability in the land column has a large influence on 
surface temperatures leading to the variability shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:scm_tlandsst}.

\section{Experiments with a Two-Dimensional Model}

The single column model in weak temperature gradient mode offered a promising 
and novel approach to investigating the land/sea contrast and the role of ocean 
forcing.  However, a few issues remained; the instability of the model under 
certain conditions has the potential to lead to unrealistic results, and 
disabling the interaction between the convection and radiation schemes damped  
any land response. In addition, the assumptions of the WTG approximation are 
only valid in the tropics, a limiting factor when attempting to explain the 
regional differences in the land response. In order to continue using the column 
model while avoiding these issues a multi column setup was used.\\

\subsection{Values of land sea contrast modelled with a two-dimensional model}

The full description of the setup is outlined in Chapter \ref{methods}. To 
reiterate, the model can be run with one or more ocean and one or more land 
columns. A number of different geometries of land and ocean columns were tested, 
with the resultant $R_{l/o}$ values shown in Table \ref{tab:tdm_Rlo}. Due to the 
instability of the model, the interaction between clouds and radiation was 
turned off for these runs. When the cloud/radiation interaction was switched off 
in the single column model in WTG mode it lead to a strong damping of $R_{l/o}$.  
In contrast, in the multi column model the imposed SSTs are still able to 
strongly influence the land surface. The values of $R_{l/o}$  are lower than the 
single column model and an amplification of the imposed SSTs is only seen for 
evaporative fractions below 0.3, and once again they increase with decreasing 
evaporative fraction.

\end{center}

The single and 2D column model was used with the purpose of understanding the 
vertical structure of the land/ocean temperature contrast. We can see from Table 
\ref{tab:tdm_Rlo} that when using small evaporative fractions we can reproduce 
the magnitude of $R_{l/o}$ so now we will compare the vertical structure with a 
GCM, with results from the ENSO-Pacemaker experiments. Using the same technique 
as in Figure \ref{fig:linreg_plev}, we use the regression coeffecient between 
the temperature at the surface and each model level to plot the response to 
warming and cooling above ocean and land surfaces.  Figures 
\ref{fig:tdm_regprof} a) and b) have some key similarities and differences; the 
ocean profiles are both very similar, they feature the large amplification 
around \SIrange{200}{400}{\hecto\pascal} due to moist convection, as well as a 
local maximum at the freezing level at \SI{600}{\hecto\pascal}.  Comparing the 
profiles above land we see a large difference above \SI{500}{\hecto\pascal}. In 
the GCM the moist convective amplification is damped above land whereas in the 
2D column model the two profiles follow each other closely. This doesn't 
necessarily imply the presence of moist convection in the land columns, merely 
that the land and ocean are more tightly linked in the 2D model. Allowing for 
this descrepency the GCM and column model are very similar.  In the area above 
\SI{800}{\hecto\pascal} the land/ocean contrast disappears and below 
\SI{800}{\hecto\pascal} the land and ocean profiles diverge to give similar 
values of $R_{l/o}$.\\
From Figure \ref{fig:tdm_regprof} we can assume that there will be difference in 
the land surface response in the GCM and 2D column model due to the descrepency 
in the upper troposphere response, but importantly the lower atmospheric 
response appears similar, making the simplified model suitable for further 
investigation of the land/ocean temperature contrast and the role of ocean 
forcing.

\subsection{Atmospheric profiles in temperature and relative humidity}

The atmospheric profiles of $\theta$ for the single column indicated that a 
changing LCL over land as well as a deviation between land and ocean lapse rates 
above the LCL can lead to $R_{l/o}>1$. We will know look at profiles of $\theta$ 
in the 2D model. The potential importance of a changing LCL motivated an 
increase in the vertical resolution of the model. The grid was non-uniform with 
85 levels, and a resolution of \SI{5}{\hecto\pascal} between 
   \SIrange{980}{800}{\hecto\pascal} and \SI{10}{\hecto\pascal} between 
   \SIrange{800}{650}{\hecto\pascal}, with the fine resolution preventing step 
   changes in the height of the LCL.  Figure \ref{fig:tdm_prof} doesn't indicate 
   any large change in the LCL over land or ocean. Looking more closely at the 
   gradient of $\theta$, in Figure \ref{fig:tdm_dthdp}, there is an indication 
   that in the ocean column the gradient of $\theta$ above the LCL does become 
   more negative with increasing SST (Fiugre \ref{fig:tdm_prof} c), which is the 
   expected result according to the Byrne and O'Gorman theory. However, we do 
   see an unusual feature; from \SIrange{900}{800}{\hecto\pascal} the land 
   profile is above, or cooler than, the ocean profile. This region of warmer 
   ocean/cooler land could have the effect of dampening the value of $R_{l/o}$ 
   and is not an expected feature. To understand what is happening we will look 
   at the profiles of relative humidity

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{{l3o1_prof_theta_ef0.05_close}.eps}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{{l3o1_prof_theta_ef0.05}.eps}
	\caption{Atmospheric profiles of theta in the 2D model for forcing SST

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\caption{Profiles of $D\theta/Dp$ in the 2D model in the land (solid) and 
	ocean (dashed) columns, showing the decrease in gradient (more negative) in 
	the ocean column with warmer SST values} \label{fig:tdm_dthdp}
\end{figure}

Regarding the warmer ocean/cooler land profile from 
\SIrange{980}{800}{\hecto\pascal}, the profiles of relative humidity are quite 
telling. The relative humidity profile in Figure \ref{fig:tdm_rhprof} a) is from 
the same run as Figure \ref{fig:tdm_prof}, it has one ocean and three land 
columns, although just two SSTs are plotted as the results are similar for a 
range of SSTs.  From the surface we see the much higher relative humidity over 
the ocean column then a sudden drop at around \SI{970}{\hecto\pascal}, to the 
extent that the ocean column becomes drier than the land columns. The dry 
region, from \SIrange{940}{800}{\hecto\pascal} coincides with the steeper 
$\theta$ lapse rate. To test whether having only one ocean column is responsible 
for the dry region, we look at a run with three ocean and three land columns.  
Figures \ref{fig:tdm_rhprof} b) c) and d) all show a similar drying in the ocean 
column. The range of evaporative fractions from 0.05 to 0.20 also shows that the 
amount of drying is largely insensitive to the humidity and moisture of the land 
columns.  The evaporative fraction has a large influence on the relative 
humidity of the land columns, for example comparing Figure \ref{fig:tdm_rhprof} 
b), c) and d) which have evaporative fractions of 
0.05, 0.10 and 0.20 respectively, the near surface humidity changes from 45\% to 
60\%, however the response of the ocean columns is very similar.  The difference 
in the dry region is at most 5\%.

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{{l3o1_prof_rh_ef0.05_close}.eps}

	0.05 (a), 0.05 (b), 0.10 (c) and 0.20 (d).}
\label{fig:tdm_rhprof}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Circulation response}
To see what is causing the drying in the ocean columns we look at the vertical 
velocity, $\omega$ and circulation using the streamfunction $\psi$ of vertical 
and zonal velocities.  For these variables we use the mean across a range of 
SSTs, as there weren't any significant changes in circulation for varying SSTs.  
The profiles of $\omega$ clearly shows the convection in the ocean columns 
(positive values of $\omega$, which is balanced with sinking motion in the land 
columns. The $\psi$ profile better demonstrates the flow in the model, and shows 
a low level circulation response. Positive values of $\psi$ indicate clockwise 
flow centered at \SI{850}{\hecto\pascal} in the ocean column nearest the land.  
This circulation is responsible for transporting dry air from the land columns.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{{l3o3_omegal_ef0.05_meansst}.eps}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{{l85co2_psi_ef0.05_meansst}.eps}
	\caption{Circulation response in the 2D model, a) Omega (vertical velocity), 
	b) Psi (streamfunction of vertical and horizontal velocity).}
	\label{fig:tdm_circ}
\end{figure}

This circulation is influencing the atmospheric structure in the ocean column, 
but is it affecting the ocean's influence of the land column, and thus the value 
of $R_{l/o}$? This drying of the atmosphere above the ocean is not present in a 
large scale across the globe and therefore could be of concern when determining 
the suitability of this simplifed model.  Figure \ref{fig:tdm_psi} shows how the 
low level circulation scales with evaporative fraction, such that the drier the 
land the stronger the low level circulation.  Refering back to Table 
\ref{tab:tdm_Rlo}, $R_{l/o}$ increases with decreasing evaporative fraction. If 
the value of $R_{l/o}$ is related to the difference in lapse rates above land 
and ocean, which in turn is related to the difference in humidity, then a drying 
of the ocean column may lead to a smaller difference between the ocean and land 
columns.\\
Instead, we see that the reduction in humidity is largely insensitive to the 
evaporative fraction (Figure \ref{fig:tdm_rhprof}) and while the strength of the 
low level circulation driving the reduced humidity increases with evaporative 
fraction, the value of $R_{l/o}$ still increases, implying that the drying of 
the ocean column is not significantly affecting the value of $R_{l/o}$, or more 
importantly, the ability of the simplified model to simulate the land/sea 
contrast.

\subsection{Values of land sea contrast for varying land parameters}

We have seen that while the two-dimensional model has a low level circulation 
that dries the ocean column, it is still able to simulate aspects of the 
land/ocean contrast we see in GCMs (i.e. Figure \ref{fig:tdm_regprof}), and it's 
response to surface properties is expected from the lapse rate of theories of 
\cite{Joshi2007} and \cite{Byrne2013a}. We now extend the range of evaporative 
fractions and vary the latitudes to build a picture of the range of $R_{l/o}$ 
values.\\
The model had 3 ocean and 3 land columns and initially was run in a zonally 
orientated domain. At each latitude an appropriate mean SST value, solar zenith 
angle and coriolis parameter were used.  The model was forced with a range of 
SSTs values which varied around the mean value for each latitude, and $R_{l/o}$ 
was calculated for each parameter.	The results, in Figure \ref{fig:tdm_Rlo} 
show the dependence of $R_{l/o}$ on evaporative fraction, but also a decrease 
with latitude, excepting the increase from \SI{0}{\degree} and \SI{10}{\degree}.  
The same experiments were also performed using a meridionally orientated domain, 
where the prescribed SST columns were nearer to the ``equator". The values of 
$R_{l/o}$ for the meridional domain show the same tendencies but at first appear 
lower than the zonal domain, however as each column spans \SI{5}{\degree} of 
latitude, if we take the $R_{l/o}$ values of a specific column and compare it to 
the corresponding latitude of the zonally orientated model we see they are quite 
similar, i.e.  Figure \ref{fig:tdm_Rlo} d). The reduction in the ability of the 
ocean columns to control land surface temperature, and hence a reduced $R_{l/o}$ 
with increasing latitude could be due to a combination of lower absolute SST 
values, or reduced transport across the domain. The latter is evident in Figure 
\ref{fig:tdm_Rlo} c), which shows the mean relative humidity in the land 
columns. The gradient of relative humidity along a constant latitude due to 
varying evaporative fraction is clear, and increasing relative humidity 
corresponds to decreasing $R_{l/o}$ as expected.  The relative humidity also 
decreases with increasing latitude, due to reduced transport of moisture from 
the ocean columns, further discussed below.  For the gradient of relative 
humidity across latitudes, decreasing relative humidity is associated with 
decreasing $R_{l/o}$, the inverse of the relationship with a constant latitude.  
This indicates that the value of $R_{l/o}$ is a not only a function of 
evaporative fraction but is also dependent on transport from ocean columns to 
land columns.\\

relative humidity at each latitude and evaporative fration, (d) uses the first 
column of the meridionally aligned model to calculate $R_{l/o}$ instead of the

\label{fig:tdm_Rlo}
\end{figure}

\section{Comparison of Simplified Models and GCM results}
The large range of $R_{l/o}$ values allows for a direct comparison to GCM 
results. Using the pacemaker experiment we can calculate an $R_{l/o}$ value for 
each individual land grid box, see Figure \ref{fig:tdm_gcm_compare} a). We do 
this by comparing the grid box surface temperature of with either the mean 
tropical SSTs, mean global SSTs or zonally averages SSTs corresponding to the 
latitude of the grid box. The latter may seem most appropriate for comparing to 
the zonally orientated 2D model, however the tropical Pacific forcing of the 
pacemaker experiment meant that a grid box $R_{l/o}$ calculated using mean 
tropical SSTs gave the most reasonable results.\\
The next step is to generate a comparative map using the 2D column model 
results. For each GCM grid box we find the latitude and evaporative fraction, 
then we take the $R_{l/o}$ from the 2D model run with corresponding parameters, 
see Figure \ref{fig:tdm_gcm_compare} b).  For example, for a point in central 
Australia at a latitude of \SI{23}{\degree} and evaporative fraction of 0.2 we 
use the $R_{l/o}$ from the 2D model at latitude \SI{20}{\degree} and evaporative 
fraction 0.2 and assign that grid box a value of 1.12, thereby building a global 
map of the expected land surface temperature response based on the results of 
the two dimensional column model.\\
The two-dimensional model required very low evaporative fractions to elicit an 
$R_{l/o}>1$, lower than would be required from a GCM or expected from 
observations. As such we wouldn't expect the magnitudes the generated $R_{l/o}$ 
response map to perfectly match a similar GCM map. However, if the 2D model was 
capturing a significant mechanism of the land/ocean temperature contrast, that 
is, the oceans control the tropospheric temperature and the drier land surface 
affects the mean lapse rate, then we might expect the broad patterns to be 
similar between the 2D model and GCM results. It is clear that the two plots in 
Figure \ref{fig:tdm_gcm_compare} share little resemblance in magnitude or 
patterns.\\
The only two large regions of the generated map with an $R_{l/o}>1$ are Saharan 
Africa and central Australia, and yet in both these regions the pattern of the 
land response differs from the GCM. For example, in Saharan Africa the generated 
map shows a very consistent $R_{l/o}$ from western coast of Africa to the 
Persian gulf, as this region is of a similar dryness. In contrast, the GCM 
results only have an $R_{l/o}>1$ for the western half of the region. Likewise in 
south-eastern Australia the GCM has a higher $R_{l/o}$ whereas the 2D model has 
lower values for that region. Another area of interest is tropical South 
America, here the GCM has high $R_{l/o}$ values and a distinctive pattern with a 
very high "blob" over the Amazon basin, none of which is present in the 2D 
model.\\
This result may be seen as an indication that the simplified radiative 
convective model is inadequate in modelling the land/sea contrast, but the model 
does capture some theoretical aspects as expected. Therefore if we consider the 
differences between the two maps in Figure \ref{fig:tdm_gcm_compare} as 
indicative of the processes missing from the simple model, we can use this as a 
guide to understanding the regional response of the land surface to an ocean 
forcing.

\label{fig:tdm_gcm_compare}
\end{figure}

An obvious process missing from the 2D model results in Figure 
\ref{fig:tdm_gcm_compare} is the interaction between clouds and radiation. This 
can lead to chaotic results but clearly might still be important. The plot from 
Figure \ref{fig:tdm_Rlo} was repeated but with the interaction between clouds 
and radiation turned on. The plot in Figure \ref{fig:tdm_Rlo_ic} is broadly 
similar in terms of the evaporative fraction, in that a drier surface tends to 
have a higher $R_{l/o}$.  The tendency of $R_{l/o}$ with latitude is different, 
we don't see a reduction with increasing latitude.  The main feature, however, 
is the randomness present in the results.  It seems at certain latitudes the 
model behaves strangely, namely at \SI{10}{\degree} where values are very low 
and \SI{40}{\degree} where they are very high. It is clear that a map created 
using these results would contain inconsistencies.

	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{{isstcosz_ic}.eps}
	\caption{Land/sea contrast ($R_{l/o}$) in 2D model for a range of

radiation turned on.}
\label{fig:tdm_Rlo_ic}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:tdm_Rlo} c) we saw that relative humidity decreased with 
increasing latitude, and this was associated with a decreasing $R_{l/o}$. It was 
theorized that the reduction in relative humidity coincided with decreased 
transport from the ocean to the land columns, which then resulted in a lower 
$R_{l/o}$. We will now look at the circulation response with latitude to 
understand the changes. As the latitude increases there is clear change in the 
circulation. At low latitudes the model is essentially one cell, with rising air 
over the ocean columns and sinking over the land. This begins to break down at 
\SI{20}{\degree} and by \SI{30}{\degree} smaller cells have formed between each 
column. This will reduce the transport of heat and moisture from the ocean 
columns to the land columns, resulting in the reduced relative humidity and 
reduced values of $R_{l/o}$ seen with increasing latitude.

\section{Mechanisms of the Extra-Tropical Response}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Relationship between land and ocean very different in extra-tropics.
	\item Discuss Barsugli, Battitsi atmospheric forcing of SST anomalies.
	\item Largest discrepancies between models and observations exist in 
		extra-tropics.
	\item Changes in cloud cover, winds induced by tropical SSTs can impact 
		extra-tropics, i.e. pacemaker and GREB model results.
	\item COWL - COld Ocean, Warm Land theory...
