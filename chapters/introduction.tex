\section{Motivation}

When looking at a timeseries of annual global land surface ($T_{land}$) and 
ocean surface temperatures (SST) there are two features which stand out; the two 
timeseries are largely covariant, and the land has greater variance than the 
ocean timeseries.  We define this increased variability of land surface relative 
to oceans as the interannual land/ocean thermal contrast. In a similar manner, 
for a transient climate the global $T_{land}$ warms with greater amplitude than 
the SST, leading to a global warming land/sea thermal contrast. In this study we 
will investigate the processes responsible for the interannual land/ocean 
contrast and test whether the processes that control the warming contrast are 
relevant for the positive and negative anomalies of natural variability.

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Land/Ocean Warming in Global Warming}

For a global warming scenario the ratio of land to sea warming tends to a value 
of around 1.5  (\citealt{Sutton2007}, \citealt{Lambert2007}, 
\citealt{Compo2008}, \citealt{Dommenget2009}). Previous studies have shown the 
land/sea warming contrast is not simply due to the larger heat capacity of the 
ocean when compared to land, but is a result of the dynamics of the climate 
system.  \citet{Sutton2007} described an energy balance argument; assuming the 
anomalous downward surface energy flux is equal over land and ocean the land/sea 
warming contrast is caused by the difference in the partitioning of the upward 
energy flux into sensible and latent heat.  \citet*{Lambert2007} proposed that 
the stability of land/sea contrast over annual, 5 year and longer timescales is 
maintained by a land to ocean heat flux where the ability of the ocean to absorb 
the extra heat leads to a damping of $T_{land}$ variability. In this scenario 
the value of the land/sea contrast depends on the ratio of the land and sea 
climate sensitivity parameters and ocean heat uptake. This can be related to the 
results of \citet{Sutton2007} and the land to ocean heat transport ignored on 
timescales where the land and ocean heat uptake is sufficiently small.  However, 
as stated by \citet{Byrne2013a} the energy balance argument does not give a 
sufficient quantitative value of land warming.  \citet{Joshi2008} proposed a 
conceptual model to explain how the SSTs can force $T_{land}$, leading to a 
land/sea warming contrast above unity.  There is a level in the atmosphere above 
which there is no significant land/sea contrast and thermal anomalies are 
transported efficiently around the globe. The lapse rate below that level is 
affected by temperature and moisture and different land and ocean lapse rates 
cause the land temperatures to reach an equilibrium warmer than the oceans.  

\citet{Dommenget2009} demonstrates the ability of oceans to cause a land/sea 
contrast on interannual and longer time scales, arguing that the asymmetric 
forcing of ocean to land is not only due to the asymmetry in area but also due 
to atmospheric water vapour feedbacks. Thus the land/sea warming contrast is a 
natural phenomena that also applies to internal interannual to decadal climate 
variability. When we think of the land/sea contrast in natural variability we 
can recognise a number of differences relative to that seen in global warming: 

Firstly, global warming is mostly a coherent warming on a global scale with a 
time evolution that is only going upwards for the relevent timescales, for 
example Compo and Sardeshmukh (2008) in figure 1b show that the pattern of 
observed surface air temperature change, calculated as the 1991--2006 average 
minus the 1961--1990 average, is largely homogeneous across the globe. In 
natural climate variability we have inhomogeneous warming and cooling patterns, 
some of them are regional others are more global, some of them have coherent 
warming and cooling (e.g. multi-pole structures) at the same time, some of them 
are closer to the land and some are over tropical warm ocean regions and others 
are over the colder extra-tropical oceans. The El Nino-Southern oscillation is 
one such mode of variability which is associated with regional warming and 
cooling \citep{Halpert1992}. When we analyse the land/sea contrast in natural 
climate variability we have to take these structures into account.

\subsection{Tropical Interannual Variability and ENSO}

When looking at the interannual variability of land and ocean the El 
Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation and its teleconnections are the leading source of 
variability on a global scale. \citet*{Klein1999} discuss the concept of an 
atmospheric bridge as a method of communicating temperature anomalies from the 
equatorial Pacific to the remote tropical oceans (outside the Pacific).  
Similarly, \citet*{Chiang2002} discuss a mechanism for warming of remote 
tropical oceans during El Ni{\~n}o conditions. The tropical tropospheric 
temperature ($T_{tropos}$) increases during El Ni{\~n}o, and is largely uniform 
across the tropical strip, 20S-20N.  They attributed the amplified response over 
land to the smaller thermal inertia and reduced cooling due to evaporation.  
\citet*{Chiang2005} further found an almost instantaneous response of $T_{land}$ 
to  El Ni{\~n}o and an ocean response with a 2-3 month lag.  The ratio between 
$T_{tropos}$ and the surface warming signal was 1:1 for land but only 1:0.3 for 
oceans.  Their findings support the mechanism over oceans described by 
\citet*{Chiang2002} as holding true on the larger scale they were investigating.  
No mechanism was proposed for land warming, the higher ratio of warming was 
attributed to differing heat capacities of ocean and land. The processes of the 
atmospheric bridge responsible for the El Ni{\~n}o teleconnections are similar 
in nature to the processes of the land/sea contrast as discussed in 
\citet{Joshi2008}, suggesting that the same principles are active.

\section{Thesis outline}

The study presented here discusses the large-scale land/sea contrast in natural 
variability, focusing on interannual timescales. We will analyse the 
characteristics of the large-scale land/sea contrast variability in observations 
and Couple General Circulation Models (CGCMs) from the CMIP5 data base. The role 
of the SST in forcing the land variability will be analysed in Atmospheric 
General Circulation Models (AGCMs) forced with observed SSTs and in a series of 
sensitivity experiments with an AGCM coupled to a slab ocean model or with fixed 
SST boundary conditions forced with different idealised SST forcings.  Our 
analysis will discuss the differences between tropical and extra-tropical 
regions.

In this article, the data and model simulations are described in the section 
2. Section 3 will discuss the evidence for the land/sea contrast larger than
unity in natural variability in observations and model simulations. This 
analysis will also explore some of the regional differences in the ocean to land 
connection. Section 4 dicsusses a series of sensitivity experiments that explore 
the role of the SST forcing, the differences between tropical and extra-tropical 
regions and that highlight the role on El Ni{\~n}o forcing.  Section 5 is an 
analysis of the mechanisms involved, illustrating how the SST forcing is 
amplified over land to result into a land/sea contrast larger than unity. In the 
final section the study will be closed with a summary and discussion.
